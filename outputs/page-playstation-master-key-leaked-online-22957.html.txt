An official statement from the console maker is due shortly.\nIn better news for Sony, a US judge has thrown out a mass lawsuit brought by users of the PlayStation Network, following a huge security breach in May 2011 which saw the user information of 69 million customers exposed.\nThe suit accused Sony of failing to adequately protect information and exposing users to identity theft.\nJudge Battaglia from the US District Court of Southern California pointed to a clause in the user agreement which noted that \"there was no such thing as perfect security\" and said that the disclaimers meant there were no grounds for the lawsuits.\nThe plaintiffs have until 9 November to appeal against the decision.\n", "comments": []}
