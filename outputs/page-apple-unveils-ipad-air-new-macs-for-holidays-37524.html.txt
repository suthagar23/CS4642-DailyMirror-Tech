The IT research outfit expects Microsoft tablets to grab 3.4 percent of the market this year, double the 1.7 percent forecast for 2013.\nMicrosoft gets 65 percent of its Windows revenue, which totaled $19.2 billion last fiscal year, from PC manufacturers which put the system on its machines, and 35 percent from other sources, chiefly people and businesses buying its software separately to install themselves.\nThe latest version of Windows, when bought separately to install on an old computer, starts at $120 for a home version and goes up to $200 for the full \u2018Pro' version. The latest Windows 8.1 upgrade was free for customers running Windows 8.\nApple's product launches on Tuesday were evolutionary, with the new iPads equipped with faster processors and better screens. Cook, at an industry conference in May, had hinted at \"several more game changers\" from Apple which could include wearable computers, but had not given a time frame.\n\"As always with Apple, expectations on systematic breakthrough hardware innovations are irrational,\" said Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said. \"Apple is good at inventing new products and at maximizing profitability of its product range over time through software innovations and clever marketing.\"\nApple's new iPad Air - its full-size tablet - is about 20 percent thinner than the previous generation of tablets, weighs one pound and starts at $499. It will go on sale on November 1.\nThe iPad mini now has a \"retina\" high-resolution screen and starts at $399, compared with $329 for the previous mini model. The two new tablets would face stiff competition, with Microsoft, Nokia and Amazon.com Inc all plugging rival devices in coming months.\nApple also showed off a new Mac Pro, a premium and high-powered cylindrical desktop computer that will be assembled in United States. It had shown the computer at a previously event.\nFor the first, Apple will launch the new iPads simultaneously in the United States and China, its biggest market, which is also a key growth region.\nApple, which jumpstarted the tablet computing market in 2010 with the first iPad, has already come under increasing pressure from cheaper devices ranging from Amazon's Kindle Fire to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's Note.\nBut while Apple is ceding market share to rivals, its superior library of apps and content should safeguard its lead for years to come, analysts say.\nLonger term however, investors hope to see real device innovation from a company that has not unveiled a new breakthrough product in years.\nCook on Tuesday dismissed the competition as directionless.\n\"Our competition is different: they're confused,\" he said. \"Now they're trying to make PCs into tablets and tablets into PCs. Who knows what they'll do next?\"\n\"We have a very clear direction and a very ambitious goal. We still believe deeply in this category and we're not slowing down on our innovation.\"\n(Reporting by Poornima Gupta and Edwin Chan; Editing by Gerald E.
