Apple\u2019s iOS has a 34.3% market share, and the rest is divided between RIM\u2019s BlackBerry (8.1%) and Microsoft\u2019s Windows Mobile and Windows Phone 7 platforms (4.3%).\nSymbian and Palm OS both have less than one percent market share: 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively.\nThis is in line with a recent report from comScore, which claimed Android topped 50% market share in February 2012.\nNielsen\u2019s numbers from recent smartphone acquirers (last three months) paint an even rosier picture for Android and iOS, with their respective market shares jumping to 54.6% and 36.3%, at the expense of everyone else.\nDigging a little bit deeper into those numbers reveals Apple\u2019s dominance on the market, as it is by far the biggest manufacturer out there with its 34.3% share. Samsung is number two with a 17% share, followed by HTC, Motorola and RIM. It\u2019s also interesting to note that overall, Nokia is bested by both Samsung and HTC even when it comes to Windows 7 handsets.\nWe\u2019ll see how these numbers will change after two extremely important devices hit the market: Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S III and Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhone, probably due to be launched this fall.\n", "comments": []}
