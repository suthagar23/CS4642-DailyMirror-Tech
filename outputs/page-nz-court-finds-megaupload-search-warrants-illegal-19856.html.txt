They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid.\"\nIn response, New Zealand's police said in a statement they were considering the judgment and were in discussions with Crown Law \"to determine what further action might be required\".\nPolice said no further comment would be made until that process was complete.\nDotcom is on bail in New Zealand, fighting attempts by U.S. authorities who are seeking to extradite him on charges of copyright theft and money laundering. An extradition hearing is set for August.\nDotcom and his lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nTelevision New Zealand quoted a spokesman for Dotcom as saying he was \"pleased\" but he would not be making any further comment on the court decision as appeals were likely.\nLawyers representing the U.S. government said the ruling had come as \"no surprise\" and that their legal team would be discussing options, including whether an appeal will be lodged, TVNZ reported.\nArmed officers, backed by helicopters, cut Dotcom out of a safe room he had barricaded himself in within the sprawling country estate, reputedly New Zealand's most expensive home. Millions of dollars in assets were seized or frozen including almost 20 luxury vehicles, dozens of computers and art works.\nBefore it was shut down in January, Megaupload was one of the world's most popular websites, where millions of users stored data, either for free or by paying for premium service. Authorities say megaupload.com and related sites cheated copyright holders out of more than $500 million.\nU.S. lawyers for Megaupload have also argued that U.S. federal authorities cannot charge the company with criminal behavior because it is Hong Kong based, and also that no papers have ever been formally served.\n(Reporting by Mantik Kusjanto; Writing by Lincoln Feast; Editing by Robert Birsel)\n", "comments": []}
