The features you do and don't get mostly make sense; joining a domain, encrypting your disk with BitLocker and being able to log into your PC remotely are business features.\nYou can connect to a PC at work from a Windows 8 system, with Remote Desktop or a VPN, you can combine multiple hard drives into one storage 'pool' that has multiple copies of your files and you can mount VHD and ISO images as if they were hard drives \u2013 but you can't boot from a VHD file.\nAnd anyone who speaks more than one language or travels between countries will be delighted that you can switch not just the keyboard but the Windows interface from one language to another without paying extra.\nWhat doesn't immediately make as much sense is that not only is Media Center not included with Windows 8; it's \"an economical media pack add-on\" that's only available for Windows 8 Pro, which is otherwise for business users (or enthusiast users).
