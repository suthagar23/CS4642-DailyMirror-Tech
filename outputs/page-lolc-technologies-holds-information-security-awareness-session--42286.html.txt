In this endeavor, to sustain a resilient banking and financial services sector in Sri Lanka, we have taken timely measures to be \u2018IT Ready\u2019. All efforts in this regard are made to prepare and strengthen ourselves for the future and to progress forward.\u201d\nProviding an insight into the programme, Oracle Asia-Pacific Director Identity Management and Security Kenneth Hee explained as follows: \u201cWe see more targeted cyber-attacks on systems now where attackers have an understanding about their targets and their vulnerabilities. The key is not to view cyber-attacks in fear; as problems which require immediate technical solutions, but to approach them as opportunities to take measured steps to strengthen the existing systems and strategically prepare them well in advance.\u201d\n\u201cThe key is to identify vulnerabilities in your systems and strategically prepare them to mitigate threats from within. By adopting a Security Inside Out approach, you can understand how resilient your security structures are and thereby transform these threats into opportunities that create long term value for your business,\u201d he concluded.\n", "comments": []}
