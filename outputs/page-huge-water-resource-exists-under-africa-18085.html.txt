At present only 5% of arable land is irrigated.\nNow scientists have for the first time been able to carry out a continent-wide analysis of the water that is hidden under the surface in aquifers. Researchers from the British Geological Survey and University College London (UCL) have mapped in detail the amount and potential yield of this groundwater resource across the continent.\nHelen Bonsor is from the BGS is one of the authors of the paper. She says that up until now groundwater was out of sight and out of mind. She hopes the new maps will open people's eyes to the potential.\n\"Where there's greatest ground water storage is in northern Africa, in the large sedimentary basins, in Libya, Algeria and Chad,\" she said.\n\"The amount of storage in those basins is equivalent to 75m thickness of water across that area - it's a huge amount.\"\nAncient events\nDue to changes in climate that have turned the Sahara into a desert over centuries many of the aquifers underneath were last filled with water over 5,000 years ago.\nThe scientists collated their information from existing hydro-geological maps from national governments as well as 283 aquifer studies.\nThe researchers say their new maps indicate that many countries currently designated as \"water scarce\" have substantial groundwater reserves.\nHowever, the scientists are cautious about the best way of accessing these hidden resources. They suggest that widespread drilling of large boreholes might not work.\nDr Alan MacDonald, lead author of the study, told the BBC: \"High yielding boreholes should not be developed without a thorough understanding of the local groundwater conditions.\n\"Appropriately sited and developed boreholes for low yielding rural water supply and hand pumps are likely to be successful.\"\nWith many aquifers not being filled due to a lack of rain, the scientists are worried that large-scale borehole developments could rapidly deplete the resource.\nMan filling jerry can African water supplies may be more resilient to climate change than was thought\nAccording to Helen Bonsor, sometimes the slower means of extraction can be more efficient.\n\"Much lower storage aquifers are present across much of sub-Saharan Africa,\" she explained.\n\"However, our work shows that with careful exploring and construction, there is sufficient groundwater under Africa to support low yielding water supplies for drinking and community irrigation.\"\nThe scientists say that there are sufficient reserves to be able to cope with the vagaries of climate change.\n\"Even in the lowest storage aquifers in semi arid areas with currently very little rainfall, ground water is indicated to have a residence time in the ground of 20 to 70 years.\" Dr Bonsor said.\n\"So at present extraction rates for drinking and small scale irrigation for agriculture groundwater will provide and will continue to provide a buffer to climate variability.\"\n", "comments": []}
