They go on to the dark corners of the internet on peer-to-peer websites,\" he said.\nHe said search engines had already been blocking inappropriate content and the latest move was just an enhancement of what was already happening.\nA better solution would be to spend \u00a31.5m on hiring 12 child protection experts and 12 co-ordinators in each of the police regions to hunt down online predators, he added.\nNSPCC chief executive officer Peter Wanless said \"a concerted and sustained effort from all quarters\" was needed to stay one step ahead of sex offenders that were getting ever more technologically advanced.\n\"This is the key child protection issue of a generation - we cannot fail,\" he said.\nA June report by the Ceop highlighted how the \"hidden internet\" helped distributors of child abuse images to evade detection by using encrypted networks and other secure methods.\nGoogle and Microsoft have agreed to work with the UK's National Crime Agency and the Internet Watch Foundation to try to tackle networks which host child abuse images.\nThe two companies are also using their technological expertise to help in the identification of abuse images.\nMicrosoft's PhotoDNA already allows a photo to be given a unique \"fingerprint\" which means it can be tracked as it is shared across the internet. Now Google has developed VideoID which does the same job with videos.\nBoth firms will provide this technology to the National Crime Agency and other organisations to help in the work of finding and detecting those behind the creating and sharing of child abuse images.\nBut critics have accused the government of underfunding online child protection.\nCeop, which is now part of the National Crime Agency, has been accused of missing a recent opportunity to identify hundreds of people downloading illegal images.\nPolice in Toronto revealed that in 2012 they had shared hundreds of names of British people with Ceop who were alleged to be customers of a Canadian firm that sold videos of young children.\nThe operation to close down the business saw hundreds of people arrested in Canada and around the world - but none in Britain.\nOn Friday, the National Crime Agency said Ceop had examined the material but it had been classified as being on a low level of seriousness. However, the agency has now ordered a review of Ceop's handling of the case.\n", "comments": []}
