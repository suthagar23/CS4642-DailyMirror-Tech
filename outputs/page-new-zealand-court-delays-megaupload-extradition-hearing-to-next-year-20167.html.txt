The court also ruled that copying the evidence by the FBI and sending it to the United States was also unlawful.\nDotcom's lawyers and the prosecution are awaiting a decision on how to handle evidence obtained under the illegal warrants and whether evidence to be used in the U.S. criminal case will be disclosed to the defense team at the extradition hearing.\nAkel said he was \"disappointed\" about the delay.\n\"You obviously want the extradition case to go ahead as soon as you can, but you have to put up with the inevitable,\" he said.\nActing on a request from the FBI, New Zealand armed police, backed by helicopters, swept into the 38-year-old Dotcom's rented estate outside Auckland in January, confiscating computers and hard drives. Dotcom and three others were arrested.\nDotcom was originally denied bail after the raid and jailed for a month, but the courts have progressively eased restrictions on him, allowing him back into his mansion, giving him access to hundreds of thousands of dollars for living and legal expenses and removing some travel and meeting restrictions.\n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Matt Driskill)\n", "comments": []}
