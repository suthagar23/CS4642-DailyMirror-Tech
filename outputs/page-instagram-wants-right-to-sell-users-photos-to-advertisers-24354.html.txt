(and) third-party advertising partners.\"\nThis means that even people who do not use Instagram could find themselves in an advertisement, if a friend snaps a picture of them and shares it.\nBut Instagram said that its aim was to make it easier to work with Facebook.\n\"This means we can do things like fight spam more effectively, detect system and reliability problems more quickly, and build better features for everyone by understanding how Instagram is used,\" it said in a statement.\n'Suicide note'\nHowever, the updated policy will not change how it handles photo ownership or who is able to see a user's pictures, it added.\nBut the new policy has triggered a backlash among social media users, with some threatening to quit.\nOne user tweeted: \"Good bye #instagram. Your new terms of service are totally stupid and nonsense. Good luck playing with the big boys.\"\nNew York-based photographer Clayton Cubbit wrote on his account that the new policy was \"Instagram's suicide note\".\nAnalysts said that the new policies could deal a blow to Facebook's reputation and alienate some users.\nRichard Holway, chairman of TechMarketView, said: \"Every time Facebook has altered their privacy policy it has led to a backlash and they've been forced to retreat. They tamper with people's privacy at a cost. People are very upset.\"\nAlan Pelz-Sharpe, research director at 451 Research, added: \"It's a barefaced tactic that Facebook and Instagram have taken, and one that will likely meet with many challenges, legally and ethically.\n\"The fact is that Facebook has critical mass, and is quite confident that such moves may cause uproar, but not a flight of business.\n\"Larger firms like Facebook are essentially trailblazing before specific regulations can catch up with them, and as we have seen with Google in the past, regulations and laws have limited real impact on their business operations - so they tend to move forward regardless of opposition.\"\n", "comments": []}
