And we're still constrained based on the amount of demand we're seeing in the marketplace.\"\nThe fact that Intel's new transistor technology - the on/off switches at the heart of its chips - are more power-efficient could be crucial to its future success.\nTo date it has been largely shut out of the smartphone and tablet markets, where devices are most commonly powered by chips based on designs by Britain's Arm Holdings.\nArm now threatens to encroach on Intel's core market with the release of Windows 8 later this year.\nMicrosoft has decided to let one variant of its operating system work on Arm's architecture, paving the way for manufacturers to build laptops targeted at users who prioritise battery life over processing speeds.\nIntel hopes a new transistor technology, in development for 11 years, will help it challenge Arm's reputation for energy efficiency.\nBell Labs created the first transistor in 1947, and it was about a quarter of the size of an American penny.\nSince then, engineers have radically shrunk them in size - so there are now more than one billion fitted inside a single processor.\nMoore's law - named after Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore - stated that the number of transistors that could be placed on an integrated circuit should double roughly every two years without a big leap in cost.\nHowever, transistors had become so small that there were fears they would become unreliable if they were shrunk much further.\n\"A lot of people had thought that Moore's law was coming to an end,\" said Mr Skaugen.\n\"What Intel has been able to do is instead of just shrinking the transistor in two dimensions, we have been able to create a three-dimensional transistor for the first time.\n\"For the user, that means the benefits of better performance and energy use will continue for as far as Intel sees on the road map.\"\nMr Skaugen said that those who use the integrated GPU (graphics processing unit) on the chips, rather than a separate graphics card, would see some of the biggest gains.\nHe said the processing speed had been significantly boosted since Sandy Bridge, meaning devices would be capable of handling high-definition video conferences and the 4K resolution offered by top-end video cameras.\nThe GPU's transcoding rate also benefits from the upgrade, allowing users to recode video more quickly if they want to send clips via email or put them on a smartphone.\nThe chips also offer new hardware-based security facilities as well as built-in USB 3.0 support. This should make it cheaper for manufacturers to offer the standard which allows quicker data transfers to hard disks, cameras and other peripherals.\nChip challenge\nIt all poses quite a challenge to Intel's main competitor in the PC processor market - Advanced Micro Devices.\nAMD plans to reduce the amount of power its upcoming Piledriver chips consume by using \"resonant clock mesh technology\" - a new process which recycles the energy used by the processor. However, full details about how it will work and a release date are yet to be announced.\nOne industry analyst told the BBC that Intel was expected to retain its lead.\n\"AMD did briefly nudge ahead of Intel in the consumer space in the early 2000s at the time of Windows XP, but since then Intel has been putting in double shifts to break away from its rival,\" said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at the consultants Davies Murphy Group Europe.\n\"Intel is making leaps ahead using proven technology, while AMD is trying to use drawing board stuff. So there's less certainty AMD will succeed, and PC manufacturers may not want to adopt its technology in any volume, at least initially.\"\nAs advanced as Ivy Bridge sounds, the one thing it is not is future-proof. Intel has already begun to discuss its successor, dubbed Haswell.\n\"We are targeting 20 times better battery life on standby - always on, always connected,\" Mr Skaugen said about the update, due for release in 2013.\n\"So you can get all your files and emails downloaded onto your PC while it's in your bag, and still get more than 10 days of standby and all-day battery life.\"\n", "comments": []}
