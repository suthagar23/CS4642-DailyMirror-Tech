Shaders are instrumental in rendering realistic effects in games.\nAll of this horsepower will allow gaming-as-a-service providers to render complex games in the cloud and encode them on the GPU so servers can simultaneously run more game streams, according to Nvidia. GPUs are more adept at rendering gaming effects than traditional CPUs, or central processing units, provided by chipmakers such as Intel.\nThe net effect for gamers is playing higher-end games on an iPad or Android device that wouldn't ordinarily support that level of game play.\nNvidia is hooking up with Gaikai, which has about two dozen data centers in the U.S., and OnLive, among other companies.\nNvidia also made a broader announcement today about its new Kepler technology, which is designed for use in large-scale data centers. Like the gaming experience described above, Kepler GPUs deliver faster streaming \"making a remote data center feel like it's just next door,\" the company said.\nGPU-assisted data centers can also be more energy efficient since GPUs are inherently more efficient at processing certain types of data.\n", "comments": []}
