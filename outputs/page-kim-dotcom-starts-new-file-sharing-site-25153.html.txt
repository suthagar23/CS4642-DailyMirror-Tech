This site is just as legitimate and has the right to exist as Dropbox, Boxnet and other competitors.\"\nHours after the site was launched, Mr Dotcom tweeted that it had received 250,000 user registrations, although limited server capacity meant Mega was unreachable to many.\nIn a series of earlier tweets Mr Dotcom said every customer would have 50 gigabytes of free storage - far more than is offered by rival services such as Dropbox or Microsoft's SkyDrive.\nMega will be encrypted so only those who upload data have access to it.\nData is also being held in the cloud to make it easy for users to get and share files.\nThe 2012 raids on Megaupload were carried out because, said US law enforcement, many users of Megaupload were engaged in pirating content and illegally sharing it.\nThey accused Mr Dotcom, and other managers at Megaupload of profiting from piracy.\nAt the launch party for Mega, Mr Dotcom made light of the incident, re-enacting the raid on his mansion by New Zealand authorities with a helicopter and actors dressed as armed police.\nHe has rebuffed the accusations of piracy and is fighting a legal battle to stay in New Zealand from where he ran Megaupload.\nA hearing on whether he can be extradited to the US has now been delayed until August.\nThe case has generated controversy in New Zealand over the way the police and intelligence services gathered evidence before the raid and won an apology to Mr Dotcom from the country's prime minister.\nMr Dotcom has also won support from prominent computer pioneers such as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\nThe raid on Megaupload put 25 petabytes of data uploaded to it by its 50 million members into a legal limbo.\nIn one message, Mr Dotcom said he was working with lawyers and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which campaigns on digital rights issues, to get access to that seized data and return it to users.\n", "comments": []}
