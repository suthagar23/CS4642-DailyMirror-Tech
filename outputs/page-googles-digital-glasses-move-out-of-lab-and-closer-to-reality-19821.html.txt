The perspective in the video shifted as wearers moved their heads to look up, down or sideways.\nThe glasses, which weigh less than some sunglasses, contain a wireless networking chip and essentially all the other technology found inside a typical smartphone - save for a cellular network radio - Google executives said.\nThe battery is smaller than a smartphone battery, but Google is working on ways to make the battery charge last for a full day.\nBrin said he expects the glasses to be available to consumers less than a year after the developer version is available.\nGoogle is still experimenting with various aspects of the glasses, including potentially providing directions on the screen and the ability to have the glasses speak out text messages, Brin said.\nHe said, in response to a question, that there are no plans to offer any kind of advertising on the device.\n(Reporting By Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Ryan Woo)\n", "comments": []}
