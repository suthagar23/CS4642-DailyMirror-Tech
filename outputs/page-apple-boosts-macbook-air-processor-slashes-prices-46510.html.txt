While that is a relatively minor performance upgrade, Intel may have improved the chip in other ways.\nFor instance, newer versions of a processor typically include manufacturing improvements, which can result in better power efficiency and cooling.\nMost consumers, however, will notice the new starting price of $899 (\u00a3749). And it's a pretty good deal when you're getting both a price drop and a processor boost.\nFinally, it's worth noting that the MacBook Air hasn't seen a major redesign since the fall of 2010. But that could change later this year. KGI Securities, NPD DisplaySearch, and others have gotten wind of an all-new, MacBook Air that's even thinner and boasts a 12-inch Retina display.\n", "comments": []}
