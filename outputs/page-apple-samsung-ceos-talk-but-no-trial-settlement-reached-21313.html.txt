South Korea's Samsung, which is trying to expand in the United States, says Apple infringed several patents, including some for its key wireless technology.\nTop executives from both companies had participated in mediation with a U.S. magistrate judge before trial, but Koh asked them to explore settlement once again.\n\"I see risks here for both sides,\" Koh said last week.\nClosing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday. In court on Monday, Samsung attorney Kevin Johnson told Koh nothing had come from the talk.\n\"We will see you tomorrow,\" Johnson said.\nThe case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, is Apple Inc v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al, No. 11-1846.\n(Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n", "comments": []}
