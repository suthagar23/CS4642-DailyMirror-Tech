Apple sold 35.1 million iPhones, taking 24.1 percent market share.\n\"The Galaxy S3 is a real challenger to the upcoming iPhone,\" said Francisco Jeronimo, an IDC analyst based in London. \"This is likely be one of the most sold smartphones this year, though the real test will come when the next iPhone is launched.\"\nThe race for global smartphone supremacy comes as Apple has accused Samsung of copying some of its products. The South Korean company counter-claims that Apple has infringed its patents. Both have denied the allegations, and a long-running court saga continues.\nApple plans to use a larger screen on the next iPhone, according to people familiar with the situation. The iPhone 4S was introduced last October.\nMORE ROUNDED\nIn a departure from its predecessor, whose look and feel became the main subject of the legal dispute with Apple, the latest Galaxy has a more rounded outline. It also has voice recognition, dubbed S Voice, which will inevitably be compared to Apple's Siri, and image recognition software that can tag and share photographs.\nPrices vary depending on the contract. A model with 16 gigabytes of memory costs up to 189 pounds ($300) under a 12-month contract with Vodafone. A similar package for the iPhone 4s costs 159 pounds, but comes with a more expensive monthly data plan.\nSamsung said it will release the S3 via 296 carriers in 145 countries by July.\nProfit from Samsung's mobile division nearly tripled in January-March to $3.6 billion, accounting for 73 percent of operating profit.\nSamsung - whose shares have gained 82 percent since late-August, beating Apple's 58 percent rise - is now banking on an aggressive marketing campaign ahead of the summer London Olympics to further drive sales. It has said its mobile market share in China doubled after the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\"The S3 is supported by an unprecedented promotional campaign,\" said Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight in London. \"Samsung's timing with the Galaxy S3 is perfect.\"\n(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle in LONDON and Tarmo Virki in HELSINKI; Editing by Ryan Woo and Ian Geoghegan)\n", "comments": []}
