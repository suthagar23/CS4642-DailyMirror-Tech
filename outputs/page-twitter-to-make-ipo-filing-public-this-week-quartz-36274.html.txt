Representatives for Twitter did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on the Quartz report.\nTwitter is leaning toward picking the New York Stock Exchange over Nasdaq for its highly anticipated initial public offering, a person familiar with the matter said last week.\nAnother person familiar with the matter said earlier this month that Twitter aimed for its shares to trade in the stock market before the U.S. holiday of Thanksgiving on November 28, a timeline also reported by Quartz on Sunday.\n(Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n", "comments": []}
