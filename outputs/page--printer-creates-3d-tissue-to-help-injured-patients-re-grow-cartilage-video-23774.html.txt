The former ensures the implant is strong, while the latter promotes cell growth, researchers said.\nTo test their performance in a living being, the implants were inserted into mice for two, four and eight weeks, with successful results.\n\u201cAfter eight weeks of implantation, the constructs appeared to have developed the structures and properties that are typical of elastic cartilage, demonstrating their potential for insertion into a patient,\u201d said the Institute of Physics, which publishes Biofabrication.\n", "comments": [{"commentterName": "daasa ", "commentterTime": "Saturday, 22 June 2013 05:51 ", "comment": "Why dont u report on the 3D printing technology they use to print real working GUNS?
