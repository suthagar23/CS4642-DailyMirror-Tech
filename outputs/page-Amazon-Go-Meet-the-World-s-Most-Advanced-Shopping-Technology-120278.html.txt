No lines, no checkout. (No, seriously.)\nAmazon created the world\u2019s most advanced shopping technology so you never have to wait in line. They call this shopping technology as \u201cJust Walk Out Shopping\u201d experience.\nConsumers simply use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products they want, and go! No checkout lines or anything.\nThis checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning.\n\u201cJust Walk Out\u201d technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you\u2019re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, Amazon will charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt. That\u2019s super neat.\nAmazon unveiled a video about the new physical store that uses the Just Walk Out technology. The new shop will sell a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. It is confirmed that the first store will be open in Seattle on early 2017, where Amazon is headquartered.\n", "comments": [{"commentterName": "S.P.RAMKUMAR ", "commentterTime": "Wednesday, 22 February 2017 08:27 ", "comment": "Thank you Daily Mirror to keep inform, Please publish this news in front page.", "thumpDown": "0", "thumpUp": "1"}]}
