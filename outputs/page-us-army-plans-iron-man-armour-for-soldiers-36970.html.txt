It's communications, antennas. It's cognitive performance. It's sensors, miniature-type circuits. That's all going to fit in here, too,\" he added.\nAccording to US Army Sgt Maj Chris Faris, \"no one industry can build it\".\nInstead the army is calling on research and development organisations, private industry as well as government labs and academia to support the project.\nThe US Army said it was likely that scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be involved in the design.\nAn MIT team is currently developing liquid body armour - made from fluids that transform into a solid when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied.\nIn an interview with US news site NPR, MIT professor Gareth McKinley compared the futuristic armour to that seen in Hollywood films.\n\"It sounds exactly like Iron Man,\" he said.\n\"The other kind of things that you see in the movies... would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human.\"\nThe aim is the get the Talos armour out in the field within three years.\n", "comments": []}
