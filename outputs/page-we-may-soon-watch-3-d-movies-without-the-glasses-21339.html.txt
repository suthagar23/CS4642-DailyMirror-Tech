When viewers wear 3-D glasses, they\u2019re able to see the two images as one, which then provides the appearance of a three dimensional figure. A new system is being developed that would only use one projector and not require glasses.\nThe new method requires a special coating on the screen to change the polarization of the light as it passes through. It\u2019s the change in polarization that creates a 3-D image.\nThe method is still being tested, and while promising, it may be years before this technology reaches commercial audiences.\n", "comments": []}
