That could be about to change, though, as TechCrunch has caught wind that the social networking giant is currently working on bringing Reactions to Messenger, and the coveted thumbs-down emoji is included.\nThe way it works is simple: Users have the option to react to individual messages in a chat thread with an emoji. When they receive a new message, all they have to do is hover over it, then tap the emoji icon to pick from seven different Reactions \u2014 heart-eyes, lol, wow, sad, angry, thumbs-up and thumbs-down.\nHowever, Facebook isn\u2019t marketing the thumbs-down emoji as a way to dislike content. Instead, it told TechCrunch it\u2019s intended to be used as a \u201cno\u201d button, in order to make everyday decisions, like choosing where to go for lunch, a lot easier for people in groups where multiple discussions are happening at the same time. Although, it accepts it\u2019ll inevitably be used as a way to show disapproval.\nReactions for Messenger, which is almost identical to Reactions for the News Feed (it\u2019s just gained a thumbs-down emoji), is currently being tested by a small number of Facebook users, and it\u2019ll only make its way to the rest if it\u2019s deemed to be useful. Given the success of Emoji Reactions in Slack, we have a feeling it\u2019ll catch on.\nSure, it\u2019s not the same as being able to dislike the slew of cat pictures that undoubtedly appear in your News Feed (although, I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d want to \u2014 cats are great), but it should certainly help introduce a much-needed form of structure in rapid-fire group chats.\n", "comments": []}
