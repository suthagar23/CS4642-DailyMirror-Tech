The issues have since been resolved and everyone should now have access to Facebook,\" company spokesman Michael Kirkland told Reuters.\nThe outages came as Facebook continued to grapple with the fallout of its botched May 18 IPO. The stock has plummeted nearly 23 percent from its IPO price, and numerous lawsuits have been filed in the wake of first-day trading glitches.\nShares of Facebook closed up 5 percent at $29.60 Thursday on the Nasdaq.\n(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad; Edwin Chan in Los Angeles; Editing by Hans-Juergen Peters)\n", "comments": []}
