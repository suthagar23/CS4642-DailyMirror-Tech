This showed people's faces and comments appearing below Street View images of a bagel shop and search results for products and places.\nMany people protested about the change to Google, and some altered their image profiles on the Google+ social network in response.\nSo far, Google has not issued an official comment about the protests over \"shared endorsements\". However, in its explanatory pages it said it was easy to opt out of the system by clicking a box on the Google+ account settings page.\nIt warned that if people did not want to be part of the programme some of their comments and follows may no longer be visible to others they know on Google+.\nSocial network Facebook faced strong criticism over a similar system called \"sponsored stories\" it rolled out in 2011.\nLegal action following the criticism eventually led to Facebook paying out $20m to compensate people whose images it used without permission.\n", "comments": []}
