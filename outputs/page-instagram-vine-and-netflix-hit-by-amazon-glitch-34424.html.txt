During this time access to the web services was intermittent with many people reporting that login pages were hard to reach or pages were taking a long time to update.\nOn the status page for its web services, Amazon said it was investigating a series of problems at the Virginia data centre. The problems hit databases, software that spreads queries across servers as well as the code controlling the core computers underlying the whole service.\nAfter the problems were resolved, Amazon said the glitch was caused by the \"partial failure of a networking device\" but added no further details.\nThe short-lived problems come less than a week after Amazon's North American web stores went offline for about 30 minutes.\n", "comments": []}
