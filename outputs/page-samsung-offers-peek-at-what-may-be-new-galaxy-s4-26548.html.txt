Today's installment involves Jeremy, the boy from the first ad, commenting on the contents of a box that ostensibly houses the Galaxy S4. He calls it \"irresistible,\" \"unreal,\" and \"totally amazing.\"\nAt one point he says, \"It's my favorite color,\" hinting the Galaxy S4 could be available in many different versions. Like the first ad, this one ends with a \"to be continued\" message.\nSamsung is expected launch its latest flagship smartphone at an event Thursday in New York City, and CNET will be there to cover the event every step of the way. Already, there has been a tremendous amount of attention and hype for the Galaxy S4, a phone expected to rival Apple's iPhone in popularity.\nThe Galaxy S4 is rumored to sport an eight-core Exynos processor, a separate eight-core graphics processing unit, a 4.99-inch Super Amoled display, 2GB of RAM, a 13-megapixel rear camera with 1080p video capability, a 2-megapixel front-facing camera, and the latest version of Android, known as 4.2.2 Jelly Bean.\n", "comments": []}
