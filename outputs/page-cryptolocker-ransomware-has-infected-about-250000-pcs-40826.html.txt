Clicking the associated link downloaded a Trojan horse called Gameover Zeus, which in turn installed Cryptolocker onto the victim's PC.\nBy mid-December, Dell Secureworks said between 200,000 to 250,000 computers had been infected.\nIt said of those affected, \"a minimum of 0.4%, and very likely many times that\" had agreed to the ransom demand, which can currently only be paid in the virtual currencies Bitcoin and MoneyPak.\n\"Anecdotal reports from victims who elected to pay the ransom indicate that the Cryptolocker threat actors honour payments by instructing infected computers to decrypt files and uninstall the malware,\" added the security firm.\n\"According to reports from victims, payments may be accepted within minutes or may take several weeks to process.\"\nHowever, Trend Micro, another security firm, has warned that giving into the blackmail request only encouraged the further spread of Cryptolocker and other copycat schemes, and said that there was no guarantee of getting the data back.\nSafety steps\nDell suggested PCs be blocked from communicating with the hundreds of domains names it had flagged as being linked to the spread of Cryptolocker, and it suggested five further steps the public and businesses could take to protect themselves:\n(Source : BBC)\n", "comments": []}
