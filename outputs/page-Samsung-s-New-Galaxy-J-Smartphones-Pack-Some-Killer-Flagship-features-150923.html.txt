These are the Samsung Galaxy J6, J7 Duo & J4. Drawing inspiration from the flagship Galaxy line-up such as the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S9, the new devices feature Samsung\u2019s Infinity Display, giving users nearly 15% more display area without increasing the overall size of the device.\nThis is due to a combination of extremely thin bezels and software powered in-display home buttons rather than hardware buttons. Further, the fingerprint sensor also moves to the back of the device for added convenience. These changes in the display hardware deliver an 18.5:9 aspect ratio giving users a better viewing experience and more browsing space. All four devices come with Samsung\u2019s Super AMOLED display technology that produces deeper contrasts and delivers the most vivid viewing experience.
