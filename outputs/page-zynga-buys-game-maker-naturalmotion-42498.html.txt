Its purchase gives Zynga an entry into the lucrative mobile games market.\nAs news of the deal emerged, Zynga also reported a loss of $25m for the fourth quarter.\nIt said it would trim its workforce by 15% - equivalent to about 314 jobs.\n\"We believe that bringing Zynga and NaturalMotion together is the right step at the right time,\" said Zynga chief executive Don Mattrick in a statement.\n\"Our acquisition of NaturalMotion will allow us to significantly expand our creative pipeline, accelerate our mobile growth and bring next-generation technology and tools to Zynga that we believe will fast-track our ability to deliver more hit games.\"\nIn a note to employees, Mr Mattrick highlighted that with the acquisition, Zynga will now have five top gaming brands: Farmville, Casino, Words with friends, CSR Racing and Clumsy Ninja in the \"people\" category.\nNaturalMotion's Clumsy Ninja has been rated more than 78,000 times in the US and UK version of Apple's App Store - the vast majority of them positive.\nNew leadership\nMr Mattrick also told employees the acquisition gives Zynga access to NaturalMotion's Euphoria technology, which helps create realistic motion for characters in movies and games.\nThe takeover of the 13-year-old firm is being interpreted by some as Mr Mattrick's bet on character-driven intellectual property.\nAs part of the terms co-founder of NaturalMotion, Torsten Reil, will stay on and report to Mr Mattick, and new games will continue to be released under the NaturalMotion brand.\nZynga has struggled to replicate the success it has had with desktop games Farmville and Mafia Wars and has been unable to generate new hits on smartphones.\nThis is seen as a crucial weakness, as more and more consumers play games on their phones.\nNaturalMotion is the biggest acquisition for the firm, and it comes after Zynga bought OMGPOP for $180m in 2012, only to see that firm's flagship game, Draw Something, shed users.\nIn June, the company announced it would cut 18% of its workforce and then a month later, it was announced that Mr Mattrick would take over from Zynga founder Mark Pincus.\nThe $25m loss actually represents good news for Zynga: it is 43% lower than the same period last year.\nInvestors cheered the news of the acquisition and the cuts, sending Zynga's stock up in after hours trading.\n", "comments": []}
