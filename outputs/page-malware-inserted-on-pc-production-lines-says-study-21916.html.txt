Also on that domain were 70,000 separate sub-domains used by 500 separate strains of malware to fool victims or steal data.\n\"We found malware capable of remotely turning on an infected computer's microphone and video camera, potentially giving a cybercriminal eyes and ears into a victim's home or business,\" said Richard Boscovich, a lawyer in Microsoft's digital crimes unit in a blogpost.\nA US court has now given Microsoft permission to seize control of the web domain, 3322.org, which it claims is involved with the Nitol infections. This will allow it to filter out legitimate data and block traffic stolen by the viruses.\nPeng Yong, the Chinese owner of the 3322.org domain, told the AP news agency that he knew nothing about Microsoft's legal action and said his company had a \"zero tolerance\" attitude towards illegal activity on the domain.\n\"Our policy unequivocally opposes the use of any of our domain names for malicious purposes,\" Peng told AP.\nHowever, he added, the sheer number of users it had to police meant it could not be sure that all activity was legitimate.\n\"We currently have 2.85 million domain names and cannot exclude that individual users might be using domain names for malicious purposes,\" he said.\n", "comments": []}
