The PS4 expands to other regions, including Europe, Australia and South America, from November 29. It then hits Japan in February.\nMicrosoft is locked in a console war with Sony this holiday season. The software giant hopes the Xbox One not only entices gamers but attracts a broader consumer base of TV fans and music lovers with its interactive entertainment features and media apps.\n\"We are working hard to create more Xbox One consoles,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of marketing and strategy at Xbox.\nRobert W. Baird & Co analyst Colin Sebastian has said he expects shipments of 2.5 million to 3 million units for both the Xbox One and PS4 in the fourth quarter.\nBoth the PS4, priced at $399 in the United States, and the Xbox One, with a price tag of $499, offer improved graphics for realistic effects, processors that allow faster game play and a slew of exclusive video games.\n(Editing by Eric Beech and Eric Walsh)\n", "comments": []}
