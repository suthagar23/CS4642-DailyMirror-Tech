Microsoft plans to price the new Surface from $899 for a 64 gigabyte version.\nThe world's largest software company also said it would keep its chain of 'pop-up' holiday stores open into the new year and will convert them into permanent retail outlets or what it called \"specialty store locations\".\nMicrosoft's recent push into physical retail - following Apple's great success - has resulted in 31 permanent stores plus 34 holiday \u2018pop-up' stores in the U.S. and Canada.\nIf Microsoft converted each of the temporary stores into permanent outlets it would have 65 stores, still well below Apple with almost 400 worldwide.\n(Reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle, Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bangalore)\n", "comments": []}
