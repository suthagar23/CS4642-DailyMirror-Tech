Indeed, its first tablet preceded the iPad by the better part of a decade. But it was a bulky laptop hybrid that required a stylus, to which it wasn\u2019t very responsive.\nBetween 2008 and 2010, the company was said to be working on a dual-touchscreen folding tablet \u2014 kind of like a book \u2014 called \u201cCourier.\u201d But Microsoft management killed that project \u2014 coincidentally, right around the time Steve Jobs launched the first iPad. (The Courier team went on to design the award-winning iPad notebook app, Paper.)\nWe\u2019ve previously seen half-baked demonstrations of Windows tablets from CEO Steve Ballmer, and of course there are a variety of third-party tablets on the way for the Windows 8 interface that works on PC, phone and tablet.\nBut this forthcoming tablet, if the rumors are to be believed, will be made in-house \u2014 much like the most successful Microsoft product of the last decade, the Xbox.\n", "comments": []}
