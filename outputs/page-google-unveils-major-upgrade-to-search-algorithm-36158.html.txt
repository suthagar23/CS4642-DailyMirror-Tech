In that sense, it is an extension of Google's \"Knowledge Graph\" concept introduced last year aimed at making interactions more human.\nIn one example, shown at the presentation, a Google executive showed off a voice search through her mobile phone, asking for pictures of the Eiffel Tower. After the pictures appeared, she then asked how tall it was. After Google correctly spoke back the correct answer, she then asked \"show me pictures of the construction\" - at which point a list of images appeared.\nHowever, one search expert cautioned that it was too early to determine Hummingbird's impact. \"For me this is more of a coming out party, rather than making me think 'wow', said Danny Sullivan, founder of Search Engine Land.\n\"If you've been watching this space, you'd have already seen how they've integrated it into the [predictive search app] Google Now and conversational search.\n\"To know that they've put this technology further into their index may have some big payoffs but we'll just have to see how it plays out,\" Mr Sullivan said.\nThe news was announced at an intimate press event at the Silicon Valley garage where founders Sergei Brin and Larry Page worked on the launch of the search engine, which is fifteen years old on Friday.\nAt the event, the search behemoth also announced an updated search app on Apple's iOS, as well as a more visible presence for voice search on its home page.\n", "comments": []}
