Non-GAAP operating margin slipped to 9 percent in the quarter from 10.4 percent a year earlier, reflecting aggressive competition from rivals such as Dell Inc and Lenovo Inc.\nWhitman, who took the helm of the world's largest PC maker more than a year ago, is trying to wean the Silicon Valley icon off sales of personal computers. Last month, she told Wall Street she expects revenue to stabilize in 2014, with some areas of growth for the company.\nWith the help of job cuts and expansion into markets and areas with longer-term potential such as enterprise computing services, the CEO is trying to revive growth.\nShares in HP climbed above $27 in extended trading, from a close of $25.09 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nRevenue fell across most of HP's business divisions except the enterprise group, whose sales edged up to $7.6 billion. Sales from HP's largest, PC-focused unit slipped 2 percent to $8.58 billion while the printing division's sales dipped 1 percent to $6.04 billion.\nIn August, Whitman replaced the head of its enterprise group Dave Donatelli with Bill Veghte who had joined HP from Microsoft. At the time, she primarily blamed poor execution by the division for a disappointing fiscal third-quarter result.\nOn Tuesday, Whitman sounded a more upbeat note for HP's second-largest division by sales.\n\"We have more to do on the margins but we are happy,\" Whitman said in an interview. \"We had a good quarter in networking, particularly in China and in Europe.\"\nHP faced an aggressive pricing environment and a tough global economy but there were \"some bright spots in Asia and in some of our emerging markets,\" she added.\nThe company's performance in China is in stark contrast to the warning of weakness in the region from rival Cisco and sales declines for IBM.\nAlthough Whitman said some of HP's other businesses didn't perform as well there as networking and noted the Chinese economy remained uncertain, she added that HP's renewed focus on the region will help mitigate some of the softness there.\nHP recently appointed telecommunications veteran Robert Mao as chairman for its China region.\nOverall, the company posted revenue of $29.1 billion, beating the $27.9 billion expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNon-GAAP net earnings fell 14 percent to $2 billion in the quarter or $1.01 per share, versus the $1.00 analysts had expected on average.\nLooking forward, HP said it expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 82 to 86 cents for its fiscal first quarter, with the top end coming in slightly higher than 85 cents expected by Wall Street analysts.\n(Editing by Edwin Chan, Richard Chang and Ken Wills)\n", "comments": []}
