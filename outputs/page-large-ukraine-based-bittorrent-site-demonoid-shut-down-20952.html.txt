But despite the setbacks Mr Van Der Sar suggested it was too soon to consign the site to history.\n\"In 2006 The Pirate Bay came back online three days after it was raided, and in the years that followed it grew out to become the largest BitTorrent site,\" he said.\nThe BPI, which represents the UK music industry, and the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) - which have both campaigned against online copyright infringement - declined to comment when approached by the BBC.\n", "comments": []}
