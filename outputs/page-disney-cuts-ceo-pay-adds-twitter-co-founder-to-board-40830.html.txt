But the weighted average of 112 percent of the targets fell below the 132 percent in 2012.\nThose measures include segment operating income, diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis, after-tax free cash flow, and return on invested capital.\nDisney also said on Monday that Judith Estrin, a former Cisco Systems Inc chief technology officer, will retire from the board at the March 18 annual meeting. The company cited its tenure policy, which limits board service to 15 years.\n(Reporting by Ronald Grover; additional reporting by Gerry Shih; Editing by Richard Chang)\n", "comments": []}
