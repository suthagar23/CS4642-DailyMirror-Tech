A General Motors plant in Michigan is gold LEED certified.\nWebb said there are only four manufacturing plants worldwide \u2014 a Coca-Cola factory in China, two lingerie plants in Sri Lanka and an LCD maker in Taiwan \u2014 to have achieved the platinum level.\n\u201cDoing LEED platinum is hard,\u201d she said, adding that only 3 percent of the 11,000 LEED-certified buildings hold the top designation. \u201cThe level of achievement is breathtaking.\u201d\n\u201ca benchmark\u201d\nJan Spies, VW\u2019s head of factory planning worldwide, termed the LEED ceremony with about 200 Germans and Americans at the plant \u201ca very special moment.\u201d\n\u201cThis plant is very much the benchmark in Volks-wagen,\u201d he said about the local facility that\u2019s one of VW\u2019s more than 60 factories globally.\nSpies wouldn\u2019t give a dollar figure of how much it cost to go for the green rating, but put the number as a single-digit percentage of the total plant price.\nDieter Schleifer, manager of plant infrastructure for VW in Chattanooga, said the factory was built to avoid wasting any energy.\nHe estimated energy savings are about 42 percent better than a standard U.S. building.\nFischer noted how Chattanooga was labeled in a 1969 CBS news report as having the dirtiest air in America. Now, he said, the city has environmentally changed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad to add to that legacy of sustainability,\u201d he said.\nHubert Waltl, the VW brand\u2019s board of management member for production and logistics, said what was learned in Chattanooga will be transferred to other facilities worldwide.\nLEED is \u201cvery ambitious,\u201d the VW official said, but environmental responsibility is key to the automaker.\nvw academy\nHans-Herbert Jagla, VW\u2019s executive vice president of human resources in Chattanooga, said the adjacent Volkswagen Academy also drew LEED platinum status.\nHe called that facility VW\u2019s most modern training academy globally.\nChattanooga Mayor Ron Littlefield said that three years ago, there were few jobs at the industrial park. Now, with the addition of VW, its supplier park, and Amazon, about 5,000 people are working at the site.\nHamilton County Mayor Jim Coppinger said he was told the VW plant\u2019s energy savings would power 750 homes annually.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a remarkable feat in itself,\u201d he said.\nTom Edd Wilson, the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce\u2019s CEO, said VW\u2019s top LEED rating can help its business recruiting efforts.\n\u201cCompanies today are much more aware and interested in being good stewards of the environment,\u201d Wilson said.\nTim Spires, who heads the Chattanooga Regional Manufacturers Association, said he spent about 30 years in the sector and is familier with the difficulty in attaining the green ranking.\n\u201cI know the effort it took,\u201d he said.\nBob Colby, executive director of the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Air Pollution Control Bureau, said for the city to be home to the world\u2019s cleanest auto assembly plant \u201cserves as a beacon to what can be done.\u201d\nU.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said in a statement that over the past 30 years, Tennessee has become the hub for the American auto industry.\n\u201cNow it also is home to the first-ever platinum LEED-certified auto assembly plant, showing that a car company can lead in both making good cars and preserving the environment,\u201d he said.\n", "comments": []}
