Pandora Media Inc (P.N) and Spotify have raced ahead while Apple's eight-month-old iTunes Radio has not made much of a dent.\nWith music downloads in decline, record labels have also put pressure on Apple to get its act together on streaming. The record labels hope Apple can turn Beats Music into a strong competitor to Spotify and other streaming services, sources familiar with the matter have said.\n\u201cApple created the digital download business and has had an amazing run, but the industry is going in the streaming service direction,\" said Daniel Weisman, a manager for Roc Nation who represents bands.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, Apple said on Wednesday. Shares in the company stood largely unchanged in after-hours trade.\nApple is also gaining a line of high-end headphones popular with a young urban demographic, bumping up its \"cool\" factor, analysts have said. But industry executives say the company was most impressed with Beats' five month-old music service.\nThe market as a whole is burgeoning. Streaming subscriptions jumped 51 percent in 2013 to $1.1 billion, out of $15 billion spent on music, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Meanwhile, downloads slipped 2.1 percent.\nThe other prize is Beats' co-founder himself. Iovine, 61, is best known as the co-founder of Interscope Records, a rap music pioneer that branched out to include acts like Lady Gaga and U2.\n\"He founded, and for more than 20 years has led Interscope, a label that has consistently been in the forefront of the music business,\" Lucian Grainge, chairman of Universal Music Group, said in a statement on Wednesday. \"We ... look forward to enhancing our partnerships with Apple and Beats for many years to come.\"\n(Additional reporting by Avik Das in Bangalore; Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Eric Walsh)\n", "comments": []}
