Some of the companies it backed two or three years ago are now at later stages, potentially requiring larger cash infusions to grow further.\nGoogle Ventures has taken an eclectic approach, investing in a broad spectrum of companies ranging from medicine to clean power to coupon companies.\nEvery year, it typically funds 40-50 \"seed-stage\" deals where it invests $250,000 or less in a company, and perhaps around 15 deals where it invests up to $10 million, Maris said. It aims to complete one or two deals annually in the $20-$50 million range, Maris said.\nSome of its investments include Nest, a smart-thermostat company; Foundation Medicine, which applies genomic analysis to cancer care; Relay Rides, a carsharing service; and smart-grid company Silver Spring Networks. Last year, its portfolio company HomeAway raised $216 million in an initial public offering.\nStill, Google Ventures lacks superstar companies such as microblogging service Twitter or online bulletin-board company Pinterest. The firm's recent hiring of high-profile entrepreneur Kevin Rose as a partner could help attract higher-profile deals.\nSoon it could have even more cash to play around with. \"Larry has repeatedly asked me: 'What do you think you could do with a billion a year?'\" said Maris, referring to Google chief executive Larry Page.\n(Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n", "comments": []}
