RSA has contacted the shops and told them about the attack.\nOn point-of-sale equipment the malicious software disguised itself as a file that handled printing.\nIt was given the name \"Chewbacca\" because the login page for the server collating data from infected machines features a picture of the Star Wars wookie.\nThe group behind the attack tried to hide its tracks by routing stolen data through the Tor network that many people use to hide where they are browsing from.\nChewbacca comes in the wake of an attack on giant US retailer Target in late 2013. That attack also inserted malware on cash tills and card swipe devices and managed to scoop up details of more than 40 million credit and debit cards.\nLuxury department store Neiman Marcus was also hit by thieves who used a similar tactic to grab card and personal details.\nThe attacks led the FBI to issue a warning to retailers alerting them to the changing attack patterns used by thieves and asking them to be vigilant about their point-of-sale equipment.\n", "comments": []}
