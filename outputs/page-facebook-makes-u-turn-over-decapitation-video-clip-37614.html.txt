For this reason, we have removed it.\"\nAt time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages.\nThe announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company.\nOn May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the \"world in which we live\".\nHowever, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack.\n\"We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content,\" it declared.\nThe company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed.\nBut at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down.\n\"The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask,\" the user wrote.\n\"She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply.\"\nAn Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video \"did not violate our community standard on graphic violence\".\nWhen questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted.\nThis prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: \"It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents.\"\nStephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was \"unhappy\" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance.\nMany of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's \"fully exposed breast\".\nFacebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: \"Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting.\"\nBut last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: \"This content is currently unavailable.\"\nIn response Mr Cameron tweeted: \"I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children.\"\nMr Balkam also welcomed the move.\n\"The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material,\" he said in a statement.\n\"In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate.\"\nLondon-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information.\n\"If they've taken it down I welcome that,\" said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC.\n\"But I want to find out more and look into this further.\"\nGoogle's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: \"Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence,\" it states.\nThere are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site.\n\"While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value,\" a spokesman added.\n\"In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site.\"\n", "comments": []}
