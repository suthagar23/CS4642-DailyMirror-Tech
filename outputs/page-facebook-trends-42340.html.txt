This opinion piece has been written by Valentino Pacheco.\nFacebook has just launched a feature called \u2018Trending Articles\u2019 on its desktop platform across selected countries such as the US, UK, Canada, India and Australia, which allows users to discover what kind of topics are most popular within their Facebook\u2019s newsfeed. This is very similar to Twitter\u2019s trending hashtags, where users are able to see a list of the hottest topics everyone is talking about. Facebook\u2019s 'Trending Articles' will appear on the top right hand corner of users\u2019 newsfeeds. The Trending section will show a personalized and more detailed list of topics, each with a heading and a few lines explaining why the topic is popular. When clicked on, a separate feed opens showing articles, photos, videos, status updates from friends and public pages.\nWith this new feature, users will have a separate \u2018trending\u2019 news section added to their feeds, enabling publishers to increase readership on their site. This means publishers can increase the efficiency behind targeting specific audience groups who \u2018share\u2019 and \u2018like\u2019 relevant stories that are culturally trending.\nPeople from all over the world visit Facebook almost every day to express their thoughts, experiences and participate in discussions. It is also a source they turn to find out about the latest news, whether it involves their closest ones or the outside world. After Facebook saw increasing spikes amongst authentic topics of conversation around Nelson Mandela, The Golden Globe Awards, Polar Vortex and 24, the social platform was motivated to add this feature onto its interface. For the attention of advertisers, this could bring them closer to their audience in a real-time conversation space; this is the space that Twitter now dominates and the space that Facebook wants to seize in order to be seen as the place to visit for cultural related stories and breaking news.\nNevertheless, Facebook could be seen as \u2018stepping on Twitter\u2019s toes\u2019 with this move and with the previous roll out of the hashtags back in June. The only difference is that Facebook\u2019s Trending seem to be personalized and helpful whereas with Twitter\u2019s trends it is sometimes difficult to understand what a trending topic is about. Facebook\u2019s \u2018Trending Articles\u2019 gives the user better context to what it\u2019s trending by having a description next to the topic.\nFacebook\u00a0 is also working to select informative, concise and accurate headlines. An advantage for Facebook is it can rely on its vast and well organized data on what people like and who they are close to, allowing Facebook to personalize based on trending topics across Facebook worldwide as well as what peers are interested in.\nAt the moment, traffic from Facebook to media sites has increased by over 170% throughout 2013. Facebook has not yet stated whether it is planning to sell sponsored trends like Twitter does, but this of course could be of great advantage for marketers and advertisers. A Facebook spokesman said that if they do, the offering is expected to be different from Twitter\u2019s promoted trends.\nMoreover, the social giant\u2019s \u2018Trending Articles\u2019, is still a very early version and is only appearing in 20 percent of its 1.2 billion users\u2019 pages and hand-picked countries.\n", "comments": []}
