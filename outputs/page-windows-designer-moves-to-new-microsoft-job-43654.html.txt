The memo and job change were earlier reported by Seattle-area tech news site GeekWire.\nThe new job means Larson-Green, known for introducing the 'ribbon' bar to the Office suite of applications, returns to software-focused design after leading the Devices and Studios group which is centered on hardware such as the Xbox game console and Surface tablet.\nHer official title will be Chief Experience Officer of the My Life & Work Team, which is part of Microsoft's Applications and Services Group, led by Qi Lu.\nLarson-Green will lead efforts to ensure Microsoft's varied software has a harmonized interface across a range of devices, which has become a key function in the era of mobile computing, where a growing number of people use a wide variety of smartphones and tablets to work and play rather than a PC.\nThe move is the first significant executive change at Microsoft under new CEO Satya Nadella, who took over from Ballmer earlier this month.\n(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Stephen Coates)\n", "comments": []}
