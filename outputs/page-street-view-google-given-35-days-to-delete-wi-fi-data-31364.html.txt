The project leaders never wanted this data, and didn't use it or even look at it.\n\"We co-operated fully with the ICO throughout its investigation, and having received its order this morning we are proceeding with our plan to delete the data.\"\nInquiries into Google's data gathering began in 2010 when it emerged an engineer had written software code to gather information from unsecured wi-fi networks.\nCars taking pictures for the company's massively popular Street View service were used to capture the information.\nThe company was fined by $25,000 (\u00a315,700) by the US Federal Communications Commission in April last year.\nThe FCC levelled heavy criticism at the company, saying it had \"deliberately impeded and delayed\" the investigation for months.\nIts investigation found that data had been discovered in 30 countries, and included \"complete email messages, email headings, instant messages and their content, logging-in credentials, medical listings and legal infractions, information in relation to online dating and visits to pornographic sites\".\nThe engineer told the FCC that at least two other Google employees, one a senior manager, knew about the data gathering.\nNick Pickles, director of the privacy campaigners Big Brother Watch, criticised the ICO decision.\n\"People will rightly look at the UK's approach to this issue and ask why, given regulators in the US and Germany have fined Google for exactly the same infringement, it is being allowed to escape with a slap on the wrist in Britain.\n\"Is our privacy somehow less worthy of protection?\"\n", "comments": []}
