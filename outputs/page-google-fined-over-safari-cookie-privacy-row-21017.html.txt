But Google got around this block by adding code to some of its adverts to make Safari think that the user had made an exception for its cookie if they interacted with the ad.\nAt the same time as using the exploit the search giant said on its help centre that Safari users did not need to take extra steps to prevent their online activities from being logged.\nGoogle said the workaround had been employed to help it deploy its +1 button - letting users show their approval for something on the web - a feature it introduced for its Google+ social network.\n\"We set the highest standards of privacy and security for our users,\" said a spokesman.\n\"The FTC is focused on a 2009 help centre page published more than two years before our consent decree, and a year before Apple changed its cookie-handling policy.\n\"We have now changed that page and taken steps to remove the ad cookies, which collected no personal information, from Apple's browsers.\"\nBut Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said it was right that Google should be penalised.\n\"It's an essential part of a properly functioning market that consumers are in control of their personal information and are able to take steps to protect their privacy,\" he said.\n\"The size of the fine in this case should deter any company from seeking to exploit underhand means of tracking consumers. It is essential that anyone who seeks to over-ride consumer choices about sharing their data is held to account.\"\n", "comments": []}
