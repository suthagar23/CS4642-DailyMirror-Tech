But the company has not made big inroads into either market.\nGartner estimates that Microsoft sold fewer than 900,000 Surface tablets in the fourth quarter, which is a fraction of the 23 million iPads sold by Apple. Microsoft has not released its own figures but has not disputed Gartner's.\nWindows phones now account for 3 percent of the global smartphone market, Gartner says, which is almost double their share a year ago but way behind Google's Android with 70 percent and Apple with 21 percent.\nTo grab more share, Klein said Microsoft was working with hardware makers to make sure Windows software is available on devices ranging from phones to tablets to larger all-in-one PCs.\n\"It's probably more nuanced than just you lower prices or raise prices,\" said Klein. \"It's less a Plan B and more, how do you tweak your plan, how do you bring these things to market to make sure you have the right offerings at the right price points?\"\nKlein did not say whether Microsoft itself was planning to move into the growing small tablet market, following the success of Apple's iPad mini, Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon.com Inc's Kindle Fire tablet.\nAlong with its partners, Klein said only that Microsoft was \"well set-up to deliver the most versatile set of experiences across form factors\".\nRegarding Microsoft's $2 billion loan to Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake to take PC maker Dell Inc private, announced last week, Klein suggested it was simply part of its efforts to support the \"ecosystem\" of PC makers.\n\"We have a long history of participating and supporting the ecosystem and that takes different forms. Oftentimes it takes the form of co-marketing, sometimes in helping with development,\" said Klein. \"In a very dynamic industry, our ability to support the ecosystem - particularly the ecosystem that is innovating on our devices and platforms - is a good thing and something we will continue to do.\"\n(Reporting By Bill Rigby; Editing by Kenneth Barry)\n", "comments": []}
