At the time, they even claimed that Kenji was capable of the robot equivalent of love. Now, however, they fear that his programming has taken an extreme turn for the worst.\n\u201cInitially, we were thrilled to see a bit of our soul come alive in this so-called \u2018machine,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Akito Takahashi, the principal investigator on the project. \u201cThis was really the last step for us in one of the fundamentals of the singularity.\u201d\nKenji was part of an experiment involving several robots loaded with custom software designed to let them react emotionally to external stimuli. After some limited environmental conditioning, Kenji first demonstrated love by bonding with a stuffed doll in his enclosure, which he would embrace for hours at a time. He would then make simple, but insistent, inquiries about the doll if it were out of sight. Researchers attributed this behavior to his programmed qualities of devotion and empathy and called the experiment a success.\nWhat they didn\u2019t count on were the effects of several months of self-iteration within the complex machine-learning code which gave Kenji his first tenderness. As of last week, Kenji\u2019s love for the doll, and indeed anybody he sets his \u2018eyes\u2019 on, is so intense that Dr. Takahashi and his team now fear to show him to outsiders.\nThe trouble all started when a young female intern began to spend several hours each day with Kenji, testing his systems and loading new software routines. When it came time to leave one evening, however, Kenji refused to let her out of his lab enclosure and used his bulky mechanical body to block her exit and hug her repeatedly. The intern was only able to escape after she had frantically phoned two senior staff members to come and temporarily de-activate Kenji.\n\u201cDespite our first enthusiasm, it has become clear that Kenji\u2019s impulses and behavior are not entirely rational or genuine,\u201d conceded Dr. Takahashi.\nEver since that incident, each time Kenji is re-activated, he instantaneously bonds with the first technician to meet his gaze and rushes to embrace them with his two 100kg hydraulic arms. It doesn\u2019t help that Kenji uses only pre-recorded dog and cat noises to communicate and is able to vocalize his love through a 20 watt speaker in his chest.\nDr. Takahashi admits that they will more than likely have to decommission Kenji permanently, but he\u2019s optimistic about one day succeeding where Kenji failed.\n\u201cThis is only a minor setback. I have full faith that we will one day live side by side with, and eventually love and be loved by, robots,\u201d he said.\n", "comments": []}
