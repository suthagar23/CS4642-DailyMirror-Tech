The phone has a sealed design that -- Samsung promises -- will protect the S4 Active from water damage for up to 30 minutes of submergence at a depth of one metre.\nMore than enough protection against dropping it in your pint, then, but Samsung also reckons you'll be able to take underwater photos using the Active's 8-megapixel camera, and a new 'Aqua Mode'.\nUnlike the disappointing Galaxy S4 Mini, the Active's specifications actually bear plenty of relation to the regular S4. You get a 1.9GHz quad-core processor and a 5-inch 1080p screen, with the only notable difference being the 8-megapixel camera, down from 13 megapixels on the normal S4.\nIt's a little chunkier, thanks to the bulky protective casing, but for those worried about smashing their phone, that's not much of a sacrifice. Personally I quite like the exposed screws and industrial styling you get on the S4 Active's rear casing.\nSamsung told CNET that the S4 Active will be out in the UK this summer. Phones 4u has confirmed they'll be selling the phone.\n", "comments": []}
