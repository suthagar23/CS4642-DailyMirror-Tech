Its shares are expected to start trading under the symbol \"FB\" on 18 May.\nMore than 10% of the business is being sold, which is expected to raise about $12bn for the company.\nThe eight-year-old social network has 900 million users worldwide and made a profit of $1bn last year.\nThere is expected to be a huge take-up, though some investors have voiced concerns about the company's longer-term growth.\nLast week, Facebook reported its first drop in revenue between quarters for two years.\nBut during a video presentation on Thursday Facebook executives sought to allay those concerns, pointing to mobile as an area for growth that the company will invest heavily in.\nLast month Facebook said it would buy the fast-growing mobile phone photo sharing app Instagram for $1bn, its largest purchase ever.\nThe higher valuation still falls short of the $100bn that had been talked about for Facebook.\nBut it is not uncommon for IPO price ranges to move up if there is strong investor demand for the stock.\nFacebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will remain in control of the company even after the IPO, controlling more than 57.3% of the voting power through shares he holds and through voting agreements with other stockholders.\nHe will own 31.5% of Facebook's outstanding stock. At the top end of the price range, this would make his holdings worth $17.6bn.\nSuch a value would put him at about number 33 on Forbes' list of the world's richest people.\n", "comments": []}
