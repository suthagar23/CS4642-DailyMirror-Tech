It has been disabled.\n'Odd request'\n\"We value our broad developer community and therefore ask everyone to adhere to the same guidelines.\"\nThe Windows Phone platform is, according to some metrics, the third most popular mobile operating system in use worldwide.\nHowever, it lags well behind Google's Android and Apple's iOS.\nAs a result, there are considerably fewer apps available for Windows Phone. To address this, Microsoft is investing its own resources to bring some key services to its platform.\nIn May, Microsoft's first attempt at creating a YouTube app was blocked after Google complained it failed to display ads correctly.\nThe companies agreed to work together to devise a new version, but Google insisted it was created using HTML5, an open web coding standard, rather than code specific to the Windows Phone platform.\nMr Howard said this was an \"odd request\", and one that was unfair to Microsoft.\n'Significant resources'\n\"Neither YouTube's iPhone app nor its Android app are built on HTML5,\" he wrote.\n\"Nevertheless, we dedicated significant engineering resources to examine the possibility.\n\"At the end of the day, experts from both companies recognised that building a YouTube app based on HTML5 would be technically difficult and time-consuming, which is why we assume YouTube has not yet made the conversion for its iPhone and Android apps.\"\n", "comments": []}
