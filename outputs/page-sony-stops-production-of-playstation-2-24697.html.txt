In total, about 11,000 games are believed to have been made for the gadget over its 12-year lifespan.\nJapanese gaming and entertainment site Famitsu reported that Sony has told the nation's retailers that it will not provide any more PS2s for sales in shops. Once existing stock is sold no more will be forthcoming.\nSony has yet to say whether it will stop production for other territories as well.\nThe PS2 is credited with being the best-selling game console of all time and its wide use is also thought to have aided the popularity of DVDs as a drive for the disks was built in to the machine.\nDespite rumours that Sony will make announcements about the PS4 in mid-2013, the firm has not given any official details of the specifications of the hardware nor when it might be released.\n", "comments": []}
