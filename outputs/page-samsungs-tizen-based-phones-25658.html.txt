This represents a significant move away from the Google-owned Android operating system it has used in most, but not all, of its devices to date.\u00a0 Based on Samsung\u2019s market share, this move could see Tizen quickly establish itself into the 3rd or 4th most used operating system behind Apple and Android.\nReleased at the beginning of 2012, Tizen is a free Linux-based, open-source software platform for multiple device categories, including smartphones, tablets, netbooks, in-vehicle infotainment devices, smart TVs and more.\u00a0 This means Tizen can provide a consistent user experience on multiple devices. It is led by Samsung, which in 2012 invested $500k to become a platinum-level member of the Linux foundation alongside IBM and Intel.\u00a0 It supports both Intel and ARM processors and its SDK and API allows developers to use HTML5 to write applications. At the moment Tizen is not the default OS on any mobile devices, but during last year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, it was shown working on a Lenovo tablet.\nSamsung is currently using Google\u2019s Android OS as well as an OS of its own, Bada, but it is thought Samsung will quickly transition all devices onto Tizen.\u00a0 This move is being largely interpreted as Samsung\u2019s response to Google\u2019s acquisition of Samsung competitor Motorola for $12.5 billion in May 2012, fearing losing its position as a leading smartphone player.\nFor Google this could mean gradually losing a powerful distribution partner in the market and therefore losing some ground to Apple\u2019s iOS.\nGiven the proliferation of operating systems and the barriers put up by their owners to make switching seem complicated and therefore undesirable, it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll begin to see the launch of \u2018switching services\u2019 \u2013 helping consumers transition content from one operating system to another. Those that can offer favorable conditions can poach users from other operating systems and devices, ensuring that the consumer buys content through them and not their competitors.\nFor advertisers it exacerbates the problem of needing to produce mobile and tablet assets for multiple operating systems.\u00a0 Most global advertisers will need to ensure they produce assets for the key operators including Apple, Android, Windows and now Tizen.\nThis new OS is not the only one challenging Android and iOS in the smartphone market: earlier this week it was announced that the Ubuntu OS would soon be available on smartphones, and Windows continues to make gains. Although these may not be the biggest threat for Apple and Android it does represent a further fragmentation of the market which should lead to more control for consumers and less autonomy for operating systems.\n", "comments": []}
