Upgrading to Windows 8 costs $40, compared to $70 for the full software package or hundreds of dollars for a new PC.\nThe latest figure does not mean that 40 million users have adopted Windows 8. Many of the sales are to PC manufacturers, who in turn sell a large number of machines to companies, very few of which are using Windows 8 yet.\nAccording to tech research firm StatCounter, about 1 percent of the world's 1.5 billion or so personal computers - making a total of around 15 million - are actually running Windows 8.\nReller did not disclose sales of Microsoft's new Surface tablet, its first-ever own-brand PC, designed to challenge the iPad head on.\nThe first Surface, based on a chip designed by ARM Holdings Plc, does not run old versions of Microsoft programs. A slightly bigger version based on an Intel Corp chip that will run the full Windows 8 Pro operating system and be fully compatible with the Office suite of applications will be available in January, Reller said.\nThe investor conference was the first public appearance for Reller since she was named as one of two executives to run the Windows unit after president Steven Sinofsky unexpectedly left two weeks ago. Julie Larson-Green heads the engineering side of Windows.\nReller said the Windows unit had survived Sinofsky's surprise departure.\n\"The team holistically is in great, great shape. And the product is in great shape,\" she said, responding to a question from a Credit Suisse analyst. \"I think transitions are always somewhat of a challenge, but I think that timing-wise it is a reasonable time, and the team is busy.\"\nEarlier in the day, Microsoft said it had sold more than 750,000 Xbox game consoles in the United States last week, including the day after Thanksgiving, one of the country's biggest shopping days.\nThat is down from 960,000 sales in the same week a year ago, in line with reduced computer game spending across the board this year, as gamers hold off on purchases in the tight economy and move toward free online games.\n(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Gary Hill, Andre Grenon and Bernard Orr)\n", "comments": []}
