A Supreme Court decision is pending on whether U.S. prosecutors must disclose evidence to be used in the hearing.\nDotcom's lawyers said they could also appeal to the Supreme Court against Wednesday's ruling.\n\"Our legal team is reviewing the rulings made by the Court of Appeal and will likely seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court,\" U.S. attorney Ira Rothken tweeted.\nDotcom says Megaupload, which housed everything from family photos to Hollywood blockbusters, was merely an online warehouse and should not be held accountable if stored content was obtained illegally.\nThe U.S. Justice Department counters that Megaupload encouraged piracy by paying users who uploaded popular content and by deleting content that was not regularly downloaded.\nA New Zealand government enquiry in 2012 found the nation's secretive spy agency acted unlawfully by giving information on Dotcom to U.S. authorities before the 2012 raid.\nDotcom's case highlights the scope of cooperation between the United States and other nations after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed a surveillance program on U.S. citizens and other targets, including missions of the European Union and EU states.\n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Stephen Coates and Clarence Fernandez)\n", "comments": []}
