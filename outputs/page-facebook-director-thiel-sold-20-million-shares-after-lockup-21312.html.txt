A spokesman for Thiel declined to comment on the sales.\nAccel Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm that was also an early backer of Facebook, distributed roughly 57.8 million Facebook shares to the limited partners and general partners of its various funds on Thursday, according to another filing. The move allows those partners to sell or hold on to their distributed Facebook shares as they see fit.\nFacebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard University dorm room, became the only U.S. company to debut with a market value of more than $100 billion. But investors have grown disillusioned with Facebook's inability to articulate a plan to reverse slowing revenue growth.\nShares of Facebook finished Monday's regular trading session at $20.01, down nearly 50 percent from their $38 offering price in May.\nMore than 1.4 billion additional shares held by early investors and Facebook employees are set to become available for trading by year's end, as additional post-IPO lockup restrictions are lifted.\n(Reporting By Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)\n(This story was corrected fix the number of shares distributed by Accel to 57.8 million)\n", "comments": []}
