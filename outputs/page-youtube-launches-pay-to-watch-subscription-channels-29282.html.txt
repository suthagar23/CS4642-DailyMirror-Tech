The service is believed to generate a small amount of revenue from advertising, but the vast majority of its content has been free-to-watch.\nTo make itself more attractive to potential advertisers, YouTube has gradually added professional content, such as full-length films and TV shows, to its vast library of amateur videos.\nYouTube says a billion people around the world use the service every month.\n\"If YouTube were a country, we'd be the third largest in the world after China and India,\" the company said in March.\n", "comments": []}
