The scientists discovered that certain tissue -- the conducting tissue that sends an electrical wave to trigger each heartbeat -- absorbed less of the solution than the muscular tissue.\nThis contrast made it easier to identify which tissue was producing electrical activity in 3D, which has until this study had been difficult to see.\n\"These new anatomically-detailed images could improve the accuracy of future computer models of the heart and help us understand how normal and abnormal heart rhythms are generated,\" Jonathan Jarvis, lead author of the study that appears this month in the journal PLoS ONE, said in a school news release.\nJarvis goes on to explain that these high-fidelity 3D images will help researchers build far more detailed computer models that in turn help better understand why the heart rhythm is vulnerable to changes in blood supply, scarring after a cardiac arrest, and even organ size.\nAs one example, Jarvis says: \"One of the major concerns for surgeons in repairing malformed hearts...is to avoid damage to the tissue that distributes electrical waves. If they had access to 3D images of the conducting tissues in malformed hearts, however, it could be possible to understand where the conducting tissue is likely to be before they operate.\"\nThe team collaborated with the University of Manchester and the Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool.\n", "comments": []}
