Sources told Reuters last month he was helping in a graft probe, rather than being targeted himself.\nZhou retired as security tsar and from the Communist Party's all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee during a sweeping leadership reshuffle last November.\nXi has identified corruption as a threat to the survival of the ruling Communist Party, and has promised to crack down on both high-flying \"tigers\" and lowly \"flies.\"\nThough Twitter is blocked in China, some state media have set up accounts in an apparent bid to reach foreign audiences.\nThe CCTV Twitter account has only about 2,480 followers, in contrast to the 9.9 million followers of its main account on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter.\nThe tweet rippled across Weibo in a matter of minutes, as some Chinese are able to skirt censorship and access Twitter, with many microbloggers expressing surprise and making fun of \"Master Kang\", as Zhou is nicknamed.\n(Reporting by Sui-Lee Wee and Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)\n", "comments": []}
