This would be the social network\u2019s third attempt to develop a smartphone, the report said, citing sources close to the matter.\nThe news comes as search engine giant Google completed the acquisition of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion earlier this week. This move could help Facebook counter that with its own foray into the smartphone hardware business.\nRumors about a possible Facebook phone have been circulating for the past few years. Although Facebook was reportedly first working on a smartphone in 2010, sources said the initiative stopped due to development complications. Meanwhile, AllThingsD has reported Facebook and manufacturer HTC were working together to develop a mobile device under the code name \u201cBuffy.\u201d\nIt\u2019s believed that \u201cBuffy\u201d may still be in development. Hiring engineers to work specifically on building Facebook phones would position the company to explore other smartphone projects, as well.\nDo you think a move into the smartphone business would be smart for Facebook or would it overextend itself?
