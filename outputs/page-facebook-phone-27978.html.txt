Except it wasn\u2019t a phone at all, rather a phone running Facebook Home, an application which changes many aspects of how the phone operates. Rather than get involved in a lengthy, and costly manufacturing & development battle with the likes of Apple, Android and all of the device manufacturers, Facebook has decided to take a short-cut in its attempt to rule the mobile web.\nThe elements of Home that have generated the most comment are the Cover Feed and Chat Heads. The first swaps out a phone\u2019s lock and home screens for live versions of the owner\u2019s News Feed. Chat Heads allows people to use Facebook\u2019s messaging services even when using another app. Both of these highlight how tightly integrated Facebook is in the new system, replacing or overlaying on top of previously core functions.\nWhilst the new system was previewed on a mid-priced new HTC Android phone, it will be released through Google Play and available on a wider variety of handsets overtime. Facebook clearly have designs on the hundreds of millions of Android handsets worldwide. There will be no Apple equivalent, as Apple would never allow such tinkering with its core products.\nFacebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has claimed that Home will help sell more Android phones. However the fact that it was launched on a phone retailing at $99 suggests that in fact Facebook is using Android\u2019s mass-market dominance as a Trojan Horse; this isn\u2019t something aimed at the early-adopters \u2013 it\u2019s for those for whom Facebook essentially is the Internet.\nThis is a clear play by Facebook to try to replicate its dominance of the desktop web on mobile devices \u2013 many put its disappointing IPO down to the fact that it wasn\u2019t adapting to mobile quickly enough. It\u2019s certainly an ambitious and aggressive move, potentially building up its already massive data pools, and enabling it to create truly personalised ad opportunities with mobility at their core. Some have suggested that Apple will be forced to start to mimic the flexibility of the Android platform in order to allow people to download Facebook Home, but it could equally have the entirely opposite effect.\nThe recent move to align Android and Chrome under one team, following the departure of founder Andy Rubin, could have many reasons. But one could be that it is starting to become hard to see how Android materially benefits Google\u2019s bottom line. Samsung & Amazon barely mention Android anymore, China\u2019s fastest growing mobile company uses it, yet most of Google\u2019s services are banned or limited in that country, and now one of Google\u2019s biggest competitors has launched a product that could well cut Google\u2019s products out of the picture.\nFacebook\u2019s mobile strategy is now clear to see: try to dominate the platforms, rather than replicate or compete with them. For advertisers who have invested heavily in Facebook up till now, this could well offer opportunities to start to take their messages to every-day phone-owners as they go about their day-to-day.\nBut equally Facebook\u2019s ambitious attempt to take-over the main parts of the mobile experience could well back-fire, whether due to consumer concerns about the amount of data Facebook will now have access to, or because Google decides it is no longer interested in building its competitors\u2019 businesses as well as its own.\n", "comments": []}
