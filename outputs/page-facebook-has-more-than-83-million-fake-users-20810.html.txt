Typically, this means profiles which have been used for sending out spam messages or other content.\n'Harm our business'\nFacebook, whose business model relies on targeted advertising, is coming under increased scrutiny over the worth of its advertising model which promotes the gathering of \"likes\" from users.\n\"We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from advertising,\" the company said in its filing.\n\"The loss of advertisers, or reduction in spending by advertisers with Facebook, could seriously harm our business.\"\nLast month, the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones set up a fake company called VirtualBagel to investigate allegations of fake \"likes\".\nHis investigation found that the large majority of \"likes\" for the fake firm originated from the Middle East and Asia.\nMany users appeared to be false, such as \"Ahmed Ronaldo\" - apparently a Cairo-based user who is employed by Spanish football club Real Madrid.\nLast week, digital distribution firm Limited Press alleged that, based on its own analytics software, 80% of clicks on its advertisements within Facebook had come from fake users.\nIn a post on its Facebook page, the company said: \"Bots were loading pages and driving up our advertising costs. So we tried contacting Facebook about this. Unfortunately, they wouldn't reply.\n\"Do we know who the bots belong too [sic]? No. Are we accusing Facebook of using bots to drive up advertising revenue. No. Is it strange? Yes.\"\nAfter a surge of attention to the company, it has since removed the Facebook posting, and said Facebook was now looking into its concerns.\n", "comments": []}
