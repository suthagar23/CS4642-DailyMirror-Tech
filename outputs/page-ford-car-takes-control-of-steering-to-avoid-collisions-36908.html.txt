Then, if necessary, it applies the brakes, scans for a gap in the road ahead, and steers to avoid a crash.\n\"You're driving down the road and a pedestrian or something comes out from either side of your vehicle from your peripheral vision where you don't have a good look at it,\" said Barb Samardzich, vice-president of product development at Ford's European division.\n\"Obstacle Avoidance can sense that the pedestrian or that object is coming across the front of your vehicle. If it doesn't sense you responding accordingly in your vehicle by braking or manoeuvring, it will take over.\"\nThe firm showed off the tech at a facility in Lommel, Belgium, earlier this week.\nThe new technology builds on safety features already offered by Ford.\nLast year it introduced Lane Keeping Alert, a feature that vibrates the wheel - but does not take control - if it detects the driver is drifting out of a lane without using an indicator.\nFord's existing Active City Stop facility also aims to reduce the severity of collisions by applying the brakes if it detects an object in front of the vehicle. But it works only if the object is static or travelling less than 30km/h (19mph) faster than the car.\nBy contrast, the company said the new tech was being tested at speeds of over 60 km/h (38mph).\nOther manufacturers involved in the project at Aachen include BMW, Fiat, Daimler, Volvo and Volkswagen. They will share data from the tests to develop systems of their own.\nVolvo - which is owned by China's Geely - has already introduced its own pedestrian and cyclist alert system, which sounds an alarm and applies the brakes. The firm told the BBC in March that it was now adapting the system so it would soon be able to recognise animals.\nThere may be resistance from some to the idea of a car taking control from its driver.\nBut Ford points out that fewer than one-third of all drivers involved in rear-end collisions had attempted to steer clear of the accident, according to data collected by Germany's Federal Statistical Office.\nWith that in mind, one independent analyst said it should not be too hard for manufacturers to convince motorists of the innovation's benefit.\n\"The logic behind the technology is impeccable - anything that can avoid a potentially dangerous situation that can cause injury or death sounds like a good piece of equipment,\" said Tim Urquhart, senior analyst at consultants IHS Automotive.\n\"Obviously it will come at a price. But there will be less resistance to a piece of technology like this than there will be to the concept of totally driverless cars.\n\"But autonomous vehicles are already being tested by Google, Daimler and others, and taking steering control in an emergency situation is obviously a pretty significant step along the road.\"\nFord said more tests were needed and it was not yet ready to announce a launch date for its Obstacle Avoidance system.\n", "comments": []}
