The glass is opaque when powered off, but it appearance transforms when electricity is applied. According to Polytron's website, \"the liquid crystal molecules line up, the incident light passes through, and Polyvision looks clear.\"\nTechnically, the glass design isn't completely see-through \u2014 the batteries and SIM card remain visible, as does the power switch up top.\nThe otherwise translucent concept design, with its dual-sided, multi-touch display, currently runs no operating system \u2014 it's just hardware. Sam Yu, Polytron's general manager, told Macworld, however, that \"All handset makers are looking to work with us. The technology is mature.\"\nPolytron aims to achieve a fully functional transparent smartphone, in limited production, by the end of the year, Mobile Geeks reported. Watch the video, above, for more on its innovative design.\nWould you use a transparent smartphone? Or would you find the practically invisible handset too easy to misplace?\nImage courtesy of YouTube, Michael Kan\n", "comments": [{"commentterName": "dreamer ", "commentterTime": "Monday, 18 February 2013 00:00 ", "comment": "i don't think this will be created  via DM Android App", "thumpDown": "0", "thumpUp": "0"}]}
