Google's new robotics division has acquired more than a half-dozen other robotics companies.\nGoogle declined to comment and Boston Dynamics did not return requests for comment. A person familiar with the matter confirmed the deal, which was first reported by the New York Times on Saturday, and said that Google will honor Boston Dynamics' military contracts.\nThe financial terms of the deal could not be learned.\nBased in Waltham, Massachusetts, Boston Dynamics was founded in 1992 as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company works with the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps and the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency, according to its website.\nThe company's website lists a catalog of nine different robots, including a DARPA-funded machine capable of scaling vertical walls using \"micro-claws,\" and a small four-wheeled vehicle that can jump 30 feet into the air and which is being developed with the U.S. Army's Rapid Equipping Force.\nThe four-legged Cheetah robot, which can surpass speeds of 29 miles per hour according to the website, is billed as the \"fastest legged robot in the world.\"\nGoogle has been tight-lipped about what it plans to do with the robots. Media reports earlier this month suggested that the company's efforts were focused on developing robotics technology that can be used in factories.\n(Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)\n", "comments": []}
