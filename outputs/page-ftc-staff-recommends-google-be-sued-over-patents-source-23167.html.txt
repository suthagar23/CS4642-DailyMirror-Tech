Many antitrust enforcers believe it is inappropriate for companies to ask for sales bans based on the infringement of essential patents.\nGoogle has sued both Apple and Microsoft in the United States, saying the companies infringed on standard essential patents, according to Florian Mueller, an expert on the smartphone patent wars.\nThe FTC is looking into a long list of complaints brought by rivals of the search company, which is also accused of using its dominance to squash rivals in vertical search areas such as shopping and travel.\nGoogle declined to discuss the report, saying \"we take our commitments to license on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms very seriously.\"\nFTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said in mid-September that he expected a decision in the case by the end of the year. A decision could be a lawsuit or, more likely, a settlement.\nGoogle has settled with U.S. law enforcement agencies in the past.\nFor example, it settled with the FTC following privacy gaffes during the botched roll out of its social network, Buzz, and later paid $22.5 million to settle charges that it bypassed the privacy settings of customers using Apple's Safari browser.\nGoogle also paid a $500 million settlement in 2011 to the Justice Department for knowingly accepting illegal advertisements from Canadian pharmacies selling in the United States.\n(Reporting By Diane Bartz; Editing by Claudia Parsons and Andre Grenon)\n", "comments": []}
