It would not, however, feature the retina display introduced with the most recent iPad in March.\nBloomberg cites \u201ctwo people with knowledge of the plans\u201d in its Tuesday report, and says the new device could be officially announced as early as October.\nSome type of \u201ciPad Mini\u201d has been speculated about for a while, but this most recent rumbling comes after a month in which Microsoft and Google both touted upcoming devices aimed to grab significant shares of the growing tablet market.\nAt a secretive and highly hyped event in mid-June, Microsoft flaunted its Surface tablet, which comes with a slick keyboard case but so far no price or launch details.
