That's still a question mark,\" Rakesh said. \"And then, what is the pricing of these systems versus the iPads and Kindles and other tablets that are out there?\"\nIntel's new Medfield processor, showcased in phones launched this year in Russia, India and the United Kingdom, surprised some critics who believed the chips would consume too much power.\nMotorola Mobility, owned by Google Inc, is expected to unveil an Intel-based smartphone in London on September 18, the first of a multi-device agreement with the chipmaker.\n\"They have a respectable seat at the (mobile) table because they surprised a lot of people with Medfield and just how well that did perform,\" said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. \"Their big chance to get more credibility will come with Motorola.\"\n(Reporting By Noel Randewich; Editing by Richard Chang)\n", "comments": []}
