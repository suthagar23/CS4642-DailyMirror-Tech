As phone prices edge lower, Qualcomm receives less revenue.\nNetwork operators worldwide are shifting to LTE, but other chipmakers are launching their own LTE chips and stepping up competition.\nQualcomm shares are up about 7 percent year to date and trade at about 14 times expected earnings. Taiwan's MediaTek Inc, a major player in low-end smartphones sold in Asia, has seen its shares jump over 30 percent in 2013 and they trade at 18 times expected earnings.\nQualcomm said in its report on Wednesday that fiscal 2014 revenue would range from $27.5 billion to $26 billion, on the low end of analysts expectations of $27.5 billion.\nThe chipmaker posted fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $6.48 billion, up 33 percent from the year-ago quarter.\nIt had net income of $1.50 billion, up 18 percent.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share were 86 cents. Is non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.05.\nIt said revenue in the fiscal first quarter, which ends in December, would range from $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion.\nAnalysts on average had expected fourth-quarter revenue of $6.346 billion and first-quarter revenue of $6.989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nQualcomm shares were down 4 percent in extended trading after closing up 1.06 percent at $69.74 on Nasdaq.\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich.
