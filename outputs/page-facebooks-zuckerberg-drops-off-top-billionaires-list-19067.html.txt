The stock closed Tuesday at $28.84, and was trading slightly up Wednesday morning at $29.33.\nIt was the first time that Facebook shares had fallen below $30. The initial public offering earlier this month, one of the largest in U.S. history, is now also one of the worst-performing, having lost over 20 percent of its value in seven trading days.\nZuckerberg\u2019s wealth is now $800 million below the last person on the list, Colombian banker Luis Carlos Sarmiento.\nTrading at $29 per share, Facebook\u2019s price-earnings, or p/e, ratio is high, at about 62.9 \u2014 and investors don\u2019t see justification for paying such a high price for such a small return.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s data, the stock price would have to drop to $23.07 to have the same average p/e ratio as other technology companies on the Nasdaq index, based on estimated earnings in the next 12 months. For example, midday Tuesday, Google\u2019s p/e was significantly lower at 17.7, and Apple\u2019s was at 13.9.\nQuestions about Facebook\u2019s revenue model have plagued the company, particularly as it audience shifts the way it views the site. The social network has made it clear that it\u2019s trying to figure out how to secure its revenue stream over mobile devices.\nMany analysts had said ahead of the initial offering that the stock was overvalued, though they believed that the stock would do well in its debut. But technological glitches delayed Facebook\u2019s debut and forced the company\u2019s underwriters to prop up the share price on its opening day; shares closed just 23 cents above issue price on the first day of trading. After that, Facebook stock never recovered.\nAnalysts have pointed to a number of other factors in the disappointing market performance. Shares are now trading in the original $28-$35 price range the company had set for its IPO, an indication that those handling the deal\u2019s offering may have been too ambitious when they raised the price to $38 for the debut. Analysts also criticized the decision to release more shares to the public than originally planned, which lowered demand for the stock.\nZuckerberg, who has been away on his honeymoon after his surprise marriage to his long-term partner Priscilla Chan, hasn\u2019t made a public comment on the stock\u2019s performance since the company\u2019s May 18 debut.\nHe has largely avoided media coverage of his honeymoon, though blogs made a lot of hay out of the fact that, as the Daily Telegraph reported, he didn\u2019t tip the waitstaff following a lunch in Rome.\n", "comments": []}
