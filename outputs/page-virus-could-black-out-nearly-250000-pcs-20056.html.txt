They said they considered the threat to be small compared with more-prevalent viruses such as Zeus and SpyEye, which infect millions of PCs and are used to commit financial fraud.\nAs of this week, about 245,000 computers worldwide were still infected by Alureon and its brethren, according to security firm Deteque. That included 45,355 computers in the United States.\nThe viruses were designed to redirect Internet traffic through rogue DNS servers controlled by criminals, according to the FBI. DNS servers are computer switchboards that direct Web traffic.\nWhen authorities took down the rogue servers, a federal judge in New York ordered that temporary servers be kept in place while the victims' machines were repaired. The temporary servers will shut down at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Monday, which means the infected PCs that have not been fixed will no longer be able to connect to the Internet.\nSome U.S. Internet providers, including AT&T Inc and Time Warner Cable, have made temporary arrangements so that their customers will be able to access the Internet using the address of the rogue DNS servers.\nInformation on how to identify and clean up infections can be found on a website that a group of security firms and other experts set up: www.dcwg.org.\n\"It's a very easy one to fix,\" said Gunter Ollmann, vice president of research for security company Damballa. \"There are plenty of tools available.\"\nMany of the machines that remain infected are probably not in active use since most victims were notified of the problem, said security expert Johannes Ullrich, who runs the Internet Storm Center, which monitors Web threats.\nThe United States has charged seven people for orchestrating the worldwide Internet fraud. Six were arrested in Estonia, while the seventh, who was living in Russia, is still at large. Tallinn has so far extradited two of the men to New York where they appeared in Manhattan federal court.\nThe case is USA v. Tsastsin et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-cr-878.\n(Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; Additional reporting by Basil Katz in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)\n", "comments": [{"commentterName": "Madie ", "commentterTime": "Thursday, 3 April 2014 22:47 ", "comment": "What a information of un-ambiguity and preserveness of valuable familiarity regarding unexpected feelings.", "thumpDown": "0", "thumpUp": "0"}]}
