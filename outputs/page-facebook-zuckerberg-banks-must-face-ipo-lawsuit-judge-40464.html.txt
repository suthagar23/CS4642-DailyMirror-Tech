The Menlo Park, California-based company's share price rose as high as $45 on May 18, 2012, its first day of trading, but quickly fell below the offering price and stayed there for more than a year.\nInvestors including pension funds in Arkansas, California and North Carolina claimed that Facebook negligently concealed material information from its IPO registration statement that it had provided to its underwriters' analysts.\nThey sought damages resulting from their having sold or holding onto the shares as they fell below the IPO price, bottoming at $17.55 on September 4, 2012.\nThe lawsuit does not allege fraud. More than 40 defendants were sued, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, lead underwriter Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nIn Wednesday trading, Facebook shares closed up 71 cents at $55.57. Facebook is expected to join the Standard & Poor's 500 index after the close of trading on Friday.\nIn court papers, the defendants had argued that Facebook had no obligation to make the requested disclosures, which they called immaterial, and that Facebook's actual results exceeded original projections.\nThey added that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other courts have said revenue projections need not be disclosed before an IPO because they are \"inherently speculative and unreliable.\"\nMorgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney declined to comment.\nThe lead plaintiffs are represented by the law firms Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, and Labaton Sucharow.\nBoth firms \"are quite pleased with the thorough and detailed opinion by the court,\" said Thomas Dubbs, a Labaton Sucharow partner, in a phone interview. \"We look forward to prosecuting this action vigorously.\"\nDubbs said U.S. securities laws allow damages to be pursued by IPO investors who sold shares at a loss, as well as by investors who held on while the share price remained below what it would have been absent the alleged violations.\nZuckerberg, 29, founded Facebook about a decade ago. Forbes magazine said he was worth $19 billion in September.\nSweet oversees litigation arising from the IPO, and the investor case combined 30 lawsuits brought around the country.\nOn Monday, the judge issued a decision that investors could also pursue claims accusing Nasdaq OMX Group Inc of concealing technology problems that led to difficulties in processing trades on Facebook's first day of trading.\nHe dismissed claims over Nasdaq's decision not to halt the IPO or cancel trades.\nSweet's decisions are dated December 11 but were not made public for several days.\nThe case is In re Facebook Inc IPO Securities and Derivative Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-md-02389.
