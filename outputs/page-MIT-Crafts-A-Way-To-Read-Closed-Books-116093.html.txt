Well, the answer is yes.\nResearchers at MIT and Georgia Tech built a prototype imaging system that can read individual pages in a stack of papers. It\u2019s an early demonstration.\nAnd as the technology improves, it could someday give, say, museum curators, another tool to study ancient, fragile books they wouldn\u2019t dare open.\nAccording to MIT news, to peer through stacks of paper, the system relies on terahertz radiation, which is a frequency band of electromagnetic radiation that falls between microwaves and infrared light.\nTerahertz imaging systems emit short bursts of radiation that can penetrate a variety of materials. Substances such as water, plastics, gases and biofuels absorb specific terahertz frequencies, which makes it easy to identify them.\nNASA used the technique to inspect foam insulation structures on its shuttle fleet, and it\u2019s the same technology used in full body scanners at the airport.\nResearchers used a standard terahertz camera to blast radiation at a stack of 20 papers with a single letter printed on each, and a sensor detected the reflected radiation.\nSo far, the system can penetrate and interpret the top nine pages in a stack of 20 \u2014 the signal looses energy the deeper it goes, resulting to too much noise. But as the relatively young technology improves, it\u2019ll be able to dive deeper.\nThe very fact that it's a possibility is exciting, however. Historians could read books that they're too afraid to touch in the first place without worrying about wear and tear.\nWith this news, it doesn't mean you'll be reading fragile manuscripts any time soon. But hopefully the system will get improvements by the time. Future is bright as we\u2019ll be able to read closed books.\n", "comments": []}
