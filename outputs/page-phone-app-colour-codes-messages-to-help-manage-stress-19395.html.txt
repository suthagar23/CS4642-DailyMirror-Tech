I'd like to see some behavioural research on the stress claims made by the authors, before we can assume that it might make our lives easier.\"\nOther research\nThe scientists say they were inspired by previous research in the area, in particular by a system called SentiCorr, developed by a team from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.\nThis is a system \"for automated sentiment analysis on multilingual user generated content from various social media and e-mails\", as described in the research paper.\nIt also uses colour coding for positive, negative or neutral content.\n\"Our system is aimed at helping individual users become more aware of the sentiment in their correspondence,\" states the paper.\n", "comments": []}
