Its popularity has seen it attract advertisers keen to tap into the potential consumer pool.\nAccording to the its latest earnings report, it generated advertising revenue of $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) in the April to June quarter this year.\nAnalysts said that if the site does eventually launch the payment feature it will help it track how many of its users actually purchased items from partner applications.\n\"Facebook does not want to remain just a platform for brand promotion and lead generation, but it wants to become the place where ecommerce deals actually happen,\" Manoj Menon, managing director of consulting firm Frost & Sullivan told the BBC.\n\"This feature will help them demonstrate to the advertisers the effectiveness of its platform in driving revenue. It is a fantastic move by Facebook,\" he added.\nHowever, some analysts were sceptical if users would trust a social networking site with their financial information.\n\"Consumers want safe, seamless and convenient mobile payments and there are a growing number of competitors that consumers trust more, such as PayPal, Visa (V.me) and others,' said Denee Carrington, an analyst with Forrester Research.\n", "comments": []}
