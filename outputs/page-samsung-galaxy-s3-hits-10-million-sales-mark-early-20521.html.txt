That translates to about 190,000 Galaxy S3 devices sold every day for the past two months.\nSamsung's flagship handset, which is available through AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon, is one of the most sought-after smartphones on the market. Last month, Sprint announced that \"overwhelming demand\" had forced the carrier to delay the handset's June 21 launch.\nHowever, keeping it on retailers' shelves has been a bit of a battle. The phone has been swept up in a patent battle between Apple and Samsung, with the iPhone maker attempting to secure an injunction against U.S. sales of the device. However, that effort was tabled due to court docket overload.\nThe Galaxy S3, which offers a dual-core processor, a 4.8-inch HD Super AMOLED display with a 1,280x720-pixel resolution, has also been the target of an Apple injunction attempt, but that effort was tabled last month when Koh ruled there were already too many issues to consider.\nCNET awarded the Galaxy S3 an Editors' Choice rating, earning four stars out of five. Reviewer Jessica Dolcourt said that the handset is \"an excellent, top-end phone,\" and includes \"high-performing hardware and creative software features.\"\n", "comments": []}
