The consistency is perfect, but I miss salt and pepper.\n\"This is meat to me. It's not falling apart.\"\nFood writer Mr Schonwald said: \"The mouthfeel is like meat. I miss the fat, there's a leanness to it, but the general bite feels like a hamburger.\n\"What was consistently different was flavour.\"\nProf Mark Post, of Maastricht University, the scientist behind the burger, remarked: \"It's a very good start.\"\nThe professor said the meat was made up of tens of billions of lab-grown cells. Asked when lab-grown burgers would reach the market, he said: \"I think it will take a while. This is just to show we can do it.\"\nSergey Brin, co-founder of Google, has been revealed as the project's mystery backer. He funded the \u00a3215,000 ($330,000) research.\nProf Tara Garnett, head of the Food Policy Research Network at Oxford University, said decision-makers needed to look beyond technological solutions.\n\"We have a situation where 1.4 billion people in the world are overweight and obese, and at the same time one billion people worldwide go to bed hungry,\" she said.\n\"That's just weird and unacceptable. The solutions don't just lie with producing more food but changing the systems of supply and access and affordability, so not just more food but better food gets to the people who need it.\"\nStem cells are the body's \"master cells\", the templates from which specialised tissue such as nerve or skin cells develop.\nMost institutes working in this area are trying to grow human tissue for transplantation to replace worn-out or diseased muscle, nerve cells or cartilage.\nProf Post is using similar techniques to grow muscle and fat for food.\nHe starts with stem cells extracted from cow muscle tissue. In the laboratory, these are cultured with nutrients and growth-promoting chemicals to help them develop and multiply. Three weeks later, there are more than a million stem cells, which are put into smaller dishes where they coalesce into small strips of muscle about a centimetre long and a few millimetres thick.\nThese strips are collected into small pellets, which are frozen. When there are enough, they are defrosted and compacted into a patty just before being cooked.\nBecause the meat is initially white in colour, Helen Breewood - who works with Prof Post - is trying to make the lab-grown muscle look red by adding the naturally-occurring compound myoglobin.\n\"If it doesn't look like normal meat, if it doesn't taste like normal meat, it's not... going to be a viable replacement,\" she said.\nShe added: \"A lot of people consider lab-grown meat repulsive at first. But if they consider what goes into producing normal meat in a slaughterhouse, I think they would also find that repulsive.\"\nCurrently, this is a work in progress. The burger revealed on Monday was coloured red with beetroot juice. The researchers have also added breadcrumbs, caramel and saffron, which were intended to add to the taste, although Ms Ruetzler said she could not taste these.\nAt the moment, scientists can only make small pieces of meat; larger ones would require artificial circulatory systems to distribute nutrients and oxygen.\nIn a statement, animal welfare campaigners People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said: \"[Lab-grown meat] will spell the end of lorries full of cows and chickens, abattoirs and factory farming. It will reduce carbon emissions, conserve water and make the food supply safer.\"\nCritics of the technology say that eating less meat would be an easier way to tackle predicted food shortages.\n", "comments": []}
