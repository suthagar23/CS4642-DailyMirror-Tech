It now faces further fines from a new investigation.\nSeparately, Microsoft said that independent lead director Reed Hastings, the CEO of online video rental company Netflix, would not seek reelection at the shareholder meeting in November. A new lead director will be chosen at the meeting, Microsoft said. Hastings, 51, said he wanted to focus on Netflix and his education work.\n(Reporting By Bill Rigby; Editing by M.D. Golan)\n", "comments": []}
