She is now unable to move her arms or legs.\nShe was implanted with two sensors - each four millimetres by four millimetres - in the motor cortex of her brain.\nA hundred tiny needles on each sensor pick up the electrical activity from about 200 individual brain cells.\n\"The way that neurons communicate with each other is by how fast they fire pulses, it's a little bit akin to listening to a Geiger counter click, and it's that property that we lock onto,\" said Professor Andrew Schwartz from the University of Pittsburgh.\nThe pulses of electricity in the brain are then translated into commands to move the arm, which bends at the elbow, wrist and could grab an object.\nJan was able to control the arm after the second day of training and over a period of 14 weeks became increasing skilful.\nThe report said she gained \"co-ordination, skill and speed almost similar to that of an able-bodied person\" by the end of the study.\nProf Schwartz told the BBC that movements this good had not been achieved before.\n\"They're fluid and they're way better, I don't know how to say it any other way, they're way better than anything that's been demonstrated before.\n\"I think it really is convincing evidence that this technology is going to be therapeutic for spinal cord injured people.\n\"They are doing tasks already that would be beneficial in their daily lives and I think that's fairly conclusive at this point.\"\nSense of touch\nThe field of harnessing a healthy brain to overcome a damaged body is advancing rapidly.\nEarlier this year, Cathy Hutchinson used a robotic arm to serve herself a drink for the first time since her stroke 15 years before.\nIn both studies the results were achieved inside a laboratory so are of little help in the home.\nResearchers are now trying to mount the arm on Jan's wheelchair so she will be able to use it in her everyday life.\nThere are also attempts to give sensation to the prosthetic arms to restore a sense of touch.\nIn a review researchers Gregoire Courtine, Silvesto Micera, Jack DiGiovanna and Jose del Millan described the control of the arm as \"highly intuitive and probably responsible for the unprecedented performance of the brain-machine interface\".\nThey added that the system was a \"remarkable technological and biomedical achievement\" and that such designs were getting closer to a point which \"might soon become revolutionary treatment models\" for paralysed patients.\n", "comments": []}
