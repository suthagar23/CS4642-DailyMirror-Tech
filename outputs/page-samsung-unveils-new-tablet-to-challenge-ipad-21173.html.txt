Consumers also tend not to spend much on tablets any more as smartphones can do most of the entertainment functions that tablets offer.\"\nSamsung has been keen to differentiate the Note 10.1 from rival tablets, which are primarily used to consume media - highlighting the device's ability to personalize and create. At Wednesday's launch event in New York, \"Moulin Rouge\" movie director Baz Luhrmann and fashion designer Zac Posen were on hand to demonstrate how they use the S-Pen stylus in their work.\nThe Galaxy 10.1 is named after its screen size, which is slightly larger than the 9.7-inch iPad, and has impressed with a split-screen feature that allows users to have two apps active side-by-side.\nSamsung hopes the bigger version of the original Galaxy Note, which has sold more than 10 million units since its October launch, can help it narrow the gap with Apple in tablet markets, where it remains a distant second to the Cupertino, California-based firm.\nApple sold 28.8 million iPads in January-June, giving it 64.4 percent of the market, well ahead of Samsung's 9.9 percent market share, according to research firm IHS iSuppli.\nThe Note 10.1 uses Google's Android software and a quad-core processor with 1.4 GHz clock speed. It boasts a 5 megapixel rear camera and 1.9 megapixel front-facing camera, which also detects the user's eye movements to prevent the device from going into standby mode.\nThe 32 GB model will sell for $549, versus iPad's $599.\nA U.S. judge on Wednesday asked for the chief executives of Apple and Samsung to speak to each other before a jury begins deliberating next week in the high-stakes patent trial between the two tech titans.\nIn Seoul on Thursday, Samsung shares were flat at 1.345 million won ($1,200) in a market down 0.1 percent. Shares in Apple closed down 0.1 percent on Nasdaq on Wednesday.\n($1 = 1129.6500 Korean won)\n(Reporting by Miyoung Kim; Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in NEW YORK; Editing by Ken Wills and Ian Geoghegan)\n", "comments": []}
