They function as like genes in our body as they get replicated and adopted by various situations. They also function as the catalyst for understanding the world around us.\nMeme starts with an idea and starts to replicate from there. Just like genes it gets evolved the way \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 works. Meme gets variations from its origin and carries messages that matter.\nIn the process, memes get shared, blended, altered and parodied in various ways. They'll become more and more representative of the condition or situation around them.\nAs time goes on, memes begin to hold more authority on the ideas they carry.\nInternet memes are the source and form of raising awareness in a particular subject.
