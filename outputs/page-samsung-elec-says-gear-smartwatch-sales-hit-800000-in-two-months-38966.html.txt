The Cupertino California-based firm is widely speculated by media and analysts to be working on wearable device.\nPriced at around $300, the Gear works as an accessory to its market leading Galaxy smartphone, with a small OLED screen offering basic functions like photos, hands-free calls and message notifications.\nMarket expectations on the device have been not so strong, as it has only around 70 dedicated applications.\nUK retailer Phones4U offered the Gear for free to consumers buying the Galaxy Note3 on contract earlier this month, while earlier media reports said that the device was suffering some 30 percent of return rates in U.S. stores of Best Buy.\n\"It's the most sold wearable watch available in the market place...and we plan to expand its availability by expanding mobile devices that work with the Gear,\" Samsung said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Miyoung Kim; Editing by Matt Driskill)\n", "comments": []}
