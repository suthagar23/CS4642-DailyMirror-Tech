The site has been hosting the malicious code since at least December 21, Darien Kindlund, senior staff scientist at security advisor FireEye, wrote in a blog Friday.\n\"We can also confirm that the malicious content hosted on the website does appear to use Adobe Flash to generate a heap spray attack against Internet Explorer version 8.0 (fully patched), which was the source of the zero-day vulnerability,\" Kindlund wrote.\nCNET has contacted Microsoft for more information and will update this report when we learn more.\n", "comments": []}
