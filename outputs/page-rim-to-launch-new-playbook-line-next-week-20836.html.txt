Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology is being widely deployed by carriers both in North America and overseas, as smartphone adoption has increased and boosted demand for wireless data downloads.\nThe 4G LTE BlackBerry PlayBook tablet will come with 32 gigabytes of memory and will be available from major Canadian carriers like BCE Inc's Bell, Rogers Communications Inc and Telus Corp in Canada on August 9.\nVariants of the tablet supporting various cellular networks are expected to be available in the coming months from carriers in other countries, RIM said.\nThe company did not release pricing details on the new PlayBook.\nHEAVY DISCOUNTS\nOver the last year RIM has been forced to offer heavy discounts to boost flagging sales, as the PlayBook runs on the QNX operating system that will power RIM's next generation of smartphones, due early next year.\nThe Waterloo, Ontario-based company needs to have more applications available before the new phones, powered by QNX software called BlackBerry 10, hit the market. It hopes greater PlayBook adoption will encourage developers to create apps for the new devices.\nRIM has struggled to compete against Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad, and a host of devices smartphone and tablet devices powered by Google's Android. The one-time technology giant's fate now rests almost completely on the success or failure of its new line of BlackBerry 10 smartphones.\nShares of RIM were down 2 percent at $6.97 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.\n(Reporting by Euan Rocha; Editing by Frank McGurty)\n", "comments": []}
