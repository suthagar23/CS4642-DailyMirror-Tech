Despite that, Glass Lewis said Thompson's roles at both companies created a potential conflict, and classified him as an \"affiliated\" director as opposed to \"independent\", which it said makes him an inappropriate choice to lead the board.\nMicrosoft's next shareholder meeting is scheduled for November 19. Shareholders have three voting options, 'for', 'against' and 'abstain'. Under Microsoft's rules, a director is elected if the number of shares cast 'for' exceeds the number of votes cast 'against' a director.\nGlass Lewis is recommending shareholders vote to re-elect the company's other eight directors, including CEO Steve Ballmer and Chairman and co-founder Bill Gates.\nBallmer announced in August that he will retire as CEO within the next 12 months, triggering the search for a new leader. It is not clear if Ballmer will retain his seat on the board after he retires, although he has said he intends to be an active shareholder in the company.\nSome investors have suggested to the board that Gates step down from his role as chairman, saying he stands in the way of radical reform at Microsoft, which has lost ground to Apple Inc and Google Inc in mobile computing. Gates has not indicated any intention of stepping down.\n(Editing by Richard Chang and Edwina Gibbs)\n", "comments": []}
