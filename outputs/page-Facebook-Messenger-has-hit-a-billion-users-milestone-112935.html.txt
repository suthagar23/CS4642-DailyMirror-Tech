On\u00a0Wednesday, the social network giant Facebook announced regarding its recent milestone of\u00a0surpassing 1 billion monthly active users on its messaging app. This comes after Facebook\u00a0Messenger crossed 900 million monthly active users in April.\nMessenger has come a long way since Facebook began pushing the messaging app in\u00a02014. In fact, the app was widely hated when Facebook eliminated messaging from its\u00a0mobile app and forced people to download Messenger.As part of this journey to 1 billion, we focused on creating the best possible experiences in\u00a0modern day communications,\u201d David Marcus, Facebook\u2019s VP of Messenger, said in a\u00a0statement.\nIt roughly suggests that 1 out of every 7 members of the population are logging onto\u00a0Facebook Messenger each month to text with friends and family.Facebook also released some stats related to its messaging service. To put its growing\u00a0popularity into perspective, according to Facebook, 22 million GIFs are sent every day, that\u00a0around 254 in a second, and popular holidays saw a noticeable uptick in user messaging,\u00a0with 300 million flowers sent on Mother's Day and 360 million valentine related\u00a0chats sent on\u00a0February 14. Among a growing, robust list of sticker packs, the app's most popular remains\u00a0related to the Angry Birds franchise.\u00a0Facebook, in the past, has credited the app\u2019s evergrowing\u00a0popularity to all the new tools\u00a0and functions it introduced for Messenger users last year such as video calling, the ability to\u00a0send money to and receive money from friends and new ways to help businesses interact\u00a0with their followers.\nA few of Facebook Messenger's wellreceived\u00a0features like\u00a0sticker packs, money\u00a0payments, and easilyshareable\u00a0GIFs will\u00a0be making their debut in the new iOS 10\u00a0Messages app this fall.WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook acquired for $22 billion in 2014, reached the same\u00a0number of users in February, while popular Chinese messaging app WeChat has 762 million\u00a0users and LINE has 218.4 million.\n", "comments": []}
