The options have an exercise price of $15.80, the closing per share price of Yahoo stock on Friday, giving them a current value of just over $5 million.\nHis earlier agreements call for $1.4 million in salary and target bonus, plus 175,000 restricted stock units or RSUs, and an option to buy 400,000 shares at a price determined by Yahoo's compensation committee.
