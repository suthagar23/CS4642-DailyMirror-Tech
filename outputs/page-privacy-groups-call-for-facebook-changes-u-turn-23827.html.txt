It is understood that it is in dialogue with regulators about the proposed changes.\nUK privacy groups have also criticised the changes.\nJim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group, said: \"Facebook is lobbying the UK government to weaken new data protection laws and reduce our legal rights.\n\"It claims that the right to have our data back or to destroy it would be unworkable. But then Facebook go and show exactly why UK citizens need new, stronger personal data laws.\"\nAs the changes have not yet been enforced, they will be subject to the voting process. If the proposals generate more than 7,000 public comments during a seven-day period, it will trigger a vote by users to approve the changes.\nHowever the vote is only binding if at least 30% of users take part. Two previous votes failed to garner that level of support.\nTo counteract criticisms of the changes, Facebook is also launching a new feature on its privacy page that lets users submit questions to its chief officer of policy, Erin Egan.\nUsers wanting to comment on the proposed Facebook changes have until Wednesday, 28 November.\nFalse rumour\nThe announcement of the changes generated a flurry of comments on the social network, including a hoax copyright protection notice that suggested the changes would mean users no longer owned the copyright to the content they post on the site.\nThe hoax document, which users were urged to post as a status update, read: \"In response to the new Facebook guidelines I hereby declare that my copyright is attached to all of my personal details. For commercial use of the above, my written consent is needed at all times.\"\nThe post quickly went viral, causing Facebook to publish a statement, quashing the false rumour.\n\"Anyone who uses Facebook owns the controls the content and information they post, as stated in our terms,\" the statement read.\n", "comments": []}
