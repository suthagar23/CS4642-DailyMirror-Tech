Not otherwise,\" it said.\nUnder new rules, unveiled by the Media Development Authority earlier this year, sites \"that report regularly on issues relating to Singapore and have significant reach among readers\" require individual licences.\nSingapore Press Holdings, the firm the runs the Straits Times, said in a statement it had the taken down the affected blog from its site and also made a police report.\nThe paper also reported that the government's IT Security Incident Response Team - set up to co-ordinate responses to a cyber intrusion, had alerted all government agencies after the video was posted on YouTube on Tuesday.\nIt quoted the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore as saying that it was \"aware of the video, and the police are investigating the matter\".\n", "comments": []}
