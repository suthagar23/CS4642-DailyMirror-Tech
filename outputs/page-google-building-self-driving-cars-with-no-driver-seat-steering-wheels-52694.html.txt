Brin said he was optimistic that the new, passenger-only self-driving cars would be approved for testing in the U.S. and overseas in the future.\n(Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n", "comments": [{"commentterName": "Great  Grat ", "commentterTime": "Sunday, 21 September 2014 10:54 ", "comment": "wow Much better than pawul paksa man...Great Harin", "thumpDown": "1", "thumpUp": "2"}, {"commentterName": "Sue ", "commentterTime": "Sunday, 21 September 2014 11:05 ", "comment": "Jayawewa Harin.
