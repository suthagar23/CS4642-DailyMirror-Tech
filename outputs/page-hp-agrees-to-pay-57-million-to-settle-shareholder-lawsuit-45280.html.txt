The company also halted sales of the TouchPad, after just seven weeks on the market.\n\"HP has reached a mutually acceptable resolution through a mediated settlement,\" said Sarah Pompei, an HP spokeswoman.\nAccording to the proposed settlement, HP will deposit $57 million into an interest-bearing escrow account within 20 days of getting an approval by U.S. District Judge Andrew Guilford in Santa Ana, California.\nThe lead plaintiffs include the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System; the Labourers' Pension Fund of Central and Eastern Canada in Oakville, Ontario; the LIUNA National Pension Fund and LIUNA Staff & Affiliates Pension Fund in Washington, D.C.; and Union Asset Management Holding AG in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\"We are very happy with the settlement and are glad to have achieved this recovery for the affected HP shareholders,\" said Jonathan Gardner, co-lead counsel for the class.\nIn the midst of a multi-year turnaround effort intended to revive growth, HP is trying to reduce its reliance on personal computers and move toward computing equipment and networking gear for enterprises.\nThe case is Gammel et al v. Hewlett-Packard Co et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 11-01404.\n(Reporting by Supriya Kurane in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)\n", "comments": []}
