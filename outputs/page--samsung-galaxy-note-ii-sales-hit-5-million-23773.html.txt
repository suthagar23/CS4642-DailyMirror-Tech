It took approximately a month for Samsung to sell the first three million units, and sales are obviously still going strong after Samsung brought the device to the U.S. on October 24.\nThe Galaxy Note II is a 5.5-inch smartphone/tablet hybrid with a stylus. It sports a 1.6 GHz quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (further expandable to 128GB via memory cards).\nWith 5 million units moved in only two months, there\u2019s no question of its success on the market. This success probably did not sit well with Apple, which recently added the Galaxy Note II \u2014 along with five other devices \u2014 to its ongoing patent lawsuit with Samsung.\n", "comments": []}
