The new brand identity is created by design firm Pentagram, the new look will\nroll out in the fall in conjunction with a new secure digital payment system, Masterpass.\nInstead of interlocking in the middle as they previously did in the old one, the two circles now\nblend into one another in a design that looks exactly like a Venn diagram.\nIn the old logo, the word MasterCard was rendered inside the interlocking circles. In the new\nlogo, the word is outside the circles. This change makes the mark more flexible - it easily\ncan be placed horizontally or vertically.Pentagram\u00a0In the old logo, the letters M and C were capitalized\u037e in the new one, all the letters are\u00a0lowercase. The result is a visual aesthetic to the contemporary world.Pentagram\u00a0This change fits with what seems to be the prevailing style in corporate logo design right now\u00a0\u2014 simple onedimensional\u00a0shapes, minimalist and seriffree\u00a0basic fonts that translate better\u00a0in digital formats. Verizon and Google have all moved in the same direction in the past year.\u00a0The new logo is also meant to mark the company's move into online payment platforms and\u00a0evolving financial services tech.\n", "comments": []}
