A USB charger, which is often used to recharge mobile phone batteries and cameras, provides about five volts.\n\"We were aiming for the highest energy efficiency we could achieve,\" said team member Allen Hawkes.\n\"We had been getting energy efficiency around 6-10%, but with this design we were able to dramatically improve energy conversion to 37%, which is comparable to what is achieved in solar cells.\"\nMetamaterials are artificial materials that display properties not usually found in nature.\nIn future, the two students and their colleague Steven Cummer hope that the technology can be built in to mobile phones. This would allow the handsets to recharge wirelessly when not being used.\nThey also believe that it could help users living in remote areas without access to the power grid. They would be able to \"harvest\" the energy from signals generated by mobile phone towers.\n\"Our work demonstrates a simple and inexpensive approach to electromagnetic power harvesting,\" said Mr Cummer.\n\"The beauty of the design is that the basic building blocks are self-contained and additive. One can simply assemble more blocks to increase the scavenged power.\"\nThe full report will be published in the journal Applied Physics Letters in December.\n", "comments": []}
