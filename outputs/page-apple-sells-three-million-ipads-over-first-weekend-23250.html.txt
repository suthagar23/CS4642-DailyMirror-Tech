Microsoft Corp became the latest major entrant to the market last month with the Windows-driven Surface.\nWhile lines for the new iPads appeared lighter than usual for a new Apple product when they began selling at stores on Friday, the company said demand was so strong that it \"practically sold out of iPad minis.\"\nApple had never before introduced two different iPad models in one quarter. Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt said that while the sales numbers looked good, the company would need to sell another 20 million iPads this quarter to meet his estimate.\n\"There's still a lot of wood to chop in the quarter,\" McCourt said.\nThe company said it had already shipped many of the new iPads ordered before the release date, but some would not be sent out until later this month.\n\"We set a new launch weekend record and practically sold out of iPad minis,\" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a statement. \"We're working hard to build more quickly to meet the incredible demand.\"\nApple shares closed up 1.35 percent at $584.62 on Nasdaq on Monday, but that was still 17 percent below the record high set in September.\nThe strong sales numbers for the iPads came despite both the iPad mini and fourth generation iPad being priced much above competing tablets. The iPad mini's $329 price had prompted some analysts to conclude that the higher price tag may hurt demand.\nBut Apple is still maintaining its industry leading margins with the smaller tablet, according to a teardown analysis of the tablet by research firm IHS iSuppli.\nThe Wi-Fi only iPad mini carries a bill of materials of $188.00, IHS iSuppli said, adding that the cost goes up to $198 when manufacturing expenses are added in.\n\"This differs markedly from Amazon's 7-inch Kindle Fire HD and Google's Nexus 7 tablets, both of which are essentially low-margin or no-margin giveaways at a $199.00 retail price,\" Andrew Rassweiler, senior principal analyst, teardown services, for IHS, said.\nBut the California company's dominance of the tablet market eroded in the third quarter as both consumer and commercial shipments declined, partly as people waited for the new iPad mini, while rival Samsung Electronics more than doubled its share, according to tablet shipment numbers from research firm IDC.\nApple's share of the tablet market fell to 50.4 percent from 59.7 percent in the third quarter while Samsung was No.2 with 18.4 percent followed by Amazon with 9 percent. Samsung's market share a year ago was 6.5 percent.\nThe 7.9-inch iPad mini marks Apple's first foray into the smaller-tablet segment and is the company's first major new device since the death of co-founder Steve Jobs last year.\nVersions of iPads with both Wi-Fi and cellular connections will not ship in the United States for another few weeks. And both will be available in more countries later this year.\nApple heads into the current quarter after refreshing almost all of its product lines, from Macintosh computers to tablets.\n\"We believe the iPad mini has the opportunity to surpass the sales of the regular-sized iPads over the next several years,\" said Topeka Capital analyst Brian White.\n(Additional reporting by Sayantani Ghosh in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Lisa Von Ahn and Phil Berlowitz)\n", "comments": []}
