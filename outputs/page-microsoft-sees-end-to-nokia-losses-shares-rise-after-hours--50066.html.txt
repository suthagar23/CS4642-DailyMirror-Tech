Lumia sales hit 5.8 million for the nine weeks of the quarter that Nokia was part of Microsoft. That compares with 35.2 million iPhone sales in the quarter. Microsoft is in the process of drastically reducing Nokia's operation, closing some facilities and cutting about half of its 25,000 workforce, as it looks to rein in costs and refocus on cloud-computing under a plan launched by new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella last week.\n\"We will be relentless in our focus on our core, agile work and life experiences and the two platforms that support it, the cloud operating system and the device operating system and hardware,\" said Nadella on the call with analysts.\nA slight recovery in the personal computer market, which was essentially flat over the past three months after two years of declines, helped sales of Microsoft's core Windows and Office products in the quarter.\nOverall quarterly revenue rose 17 percent to $23.38 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $23 billion, although the bulk of that was due to the addition of sales from Nokia.\nMicrosoft reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $4.61 billion, or 55 cents per share, compared with $4.96 billion, or 59 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.\nWall Street had expected 60 cents per share, on average, although it is not clear how analysts had factored in the performance and cost of integrating the Nokia operation.\n(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Bernard Orr)\n", "comments": []}
