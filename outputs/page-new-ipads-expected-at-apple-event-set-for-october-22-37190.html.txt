The usual stylized, elliptical apple-stalk is replicated and scattered throughout an attached image in multiple hues.\nNew versions of the iPad, which will go up against Amazon.com's latest Kindle Fires and gadgets made by Samsung, are expected to feature lighter, thinner designs and more powerful processors. The iPhone maker has come under pressure over the past year to preserve market share and bolster sales against rivals that are rapidly raising capabilities and lowering prices.\nNews of the October 22 event was first reported by AllThingsD last week.\n(Editing by Steve Orlofsky)\n", "comments": []}
