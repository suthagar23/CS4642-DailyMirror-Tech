The device is already available in France, Germany, Spain, Canada, the UK and the United States, according to Google.\nJapan has rapidly embraced the smartphone, with devices running Google's Android operating system tripling in the past year, according to Google. Google said that Japan now ranks third in terms of downloaded applications from its Play store.\nGoogle makes most of its money from advertising and with the rise of mobile users, is seeing increasing traffic to its YouTube video website. In Japan and South Korea, more than half of YouTube downloads are from mobile devices, some of the highest ratios in the world.\nGoogle's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, attended the launch and later told a briefing that growth in the smartphone market would lead to a boom in new startup companies in Japan focused on shopping.\n\"It is the defining platform and the defining battle in our industry,\" he said.\nWhile Google has long lagged Yahoo Japan in the domestic search market, in launching the tablet and downloadable content, it has stolen a march on Amazon.com Inc, which has yet to launch its own Kindle in Japan. Local player Rakuten Inc launched its own e-reader device, the Kobo, in July.\nThe primary challenge has been persuading local content providers to share content. Google said that in addition to the movies for rent it has offered Japanese consumers, it would for the first time sell movies from Sony Corp and Paramount.\nIn addition, Google will begin providing Japanese-language book titles on Google Play. The Android system allows users to read the same titles and pick up where they lift off on another device.\nThe global tablet market is dominated by Apple Inc and its iPad, which represented about 70 percent of global sales in the second quarter, and also includes Barnes & Noble Inc's Nook and Samsung Electronic's Galaxy Tab.\n(Reporting by James Topham, Kevin Krolicki; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim and Matt Driskill)\n", "comments": []}
