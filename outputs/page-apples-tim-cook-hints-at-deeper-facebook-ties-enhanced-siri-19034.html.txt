But he did drop a few breadcrumbs for Apple speculators to follow.\nSpeaking about Facebook, Cook said he thought Apple\u2019s relationship with the social network is \u201cvery solid\u201d and that Apple could do more with the company. He encouraged people to \u201cstay tuned.\u201d Many read that as a hint that deeper ties to Facebook might be coming in iOS 6 \u2014 similar to how Apple integrated Twitter at the OS level in iOS and OS X 10.8 \u201cMountain Lion\u201d \u2014 but Cook wouldn\u2019t elaborate.\nIf Apple does strengthen its relationship with Facebook, it would be further reason for the company to finally do away with Ping, Apple\u2019s ill-fated attempt at a social network. Cook said he had thought about killing Ping when a member of the audience asked him about it, but he also noted that some customers really love it.\nCook also suggested that Siri, the voice assistant on the iPhone 4S, would be getting some enhancements in the near future. After saying Siri proved that people want to interact with their phones in new ways, Cook said the it could be broader, and that the potential was \u201cunbelievable.\u201d\n\u201cI think you are going to be really pleased with where we take Siri,\u201d he said.\nAsked about product secrecy, Cook said Apple would be \u201cdoubling down\u201d on it, while at the same time explaining Apple would behave more openly with regard to its Asian suppliers\u2019 practices. At the suggestion of an U.S.-based Apple factory, Cook didn\u2019t entirely shoot down the idea, but he did say there would have to be big changes for that to happen.\n\u201cCould assembly process be done in the US someday? I hope so,\u201d Cook said. \u201c[There] has to be a fundamental change in education system to make it possible.\u201d\nOn the neverending rumor that Apple is in the early stages of making a TV set, Cook didn\u2019t budge. While he said Apple\u2019s relationship with Hollywood was \u201cgood,\u201d Cook simply didn\u2019t answer when asked whether Apple was building a television or even the more general \u201cliving room content service.\u201d\nUltimately, Cook guarded against saying too much during the interview, apart from dropping the first public acknowledgement from Apple that Ping is a failure. However, he did reveal some more insight into his thinking, and how profound an influence Steve Jobs has been in his life and career.\n", "comments": []}
