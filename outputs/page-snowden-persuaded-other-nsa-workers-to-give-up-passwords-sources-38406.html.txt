If you've been cleared and especially if you've been polygraphed, you're an insider and you are presumed to be trustworthy,\" said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert with the Federation of American Scientists.\n\"What agencies are having a hard time grappling with is the insider threat, the idea that the guy in the next cubicle may not be reliable,\" he added.\nOfficials with the NSA and the Office of Director of National Intelligence declined to comment due to a criminal investigation related to Snowden, who disclosed previously secret U.S. government mass surveillance programs while in Hong Kong in June and then fled to Russia where he was granted temporary asylum.\nPeople familiar with efforts to assess the damage to U.S. intelligence caused by Snowden's leaks have said assessments are proceeding slowly because Snowden succeeded in obscuring some electronic traces of how he accessed NSA records.\nThe sources did not know if the NSA employees who were removed from their assignments were given other duties or fired.\nWhile the U.S. government now believes it has a good idea of all the data to which Snowden could have accessed, investigators are not positive which and how much of that data Snowden actually downloaded, the sources said.\nSnowden and some of his interlocutors, such as former Guardian writer Glenn Greenwald, have said that Snowden provided NSA secrets only to media representatives such as Greenwald, filmmaker Laura Poitras, and a reporter with the British newspaper.\nThey have emphatically denied that he provided any classified material to countries such as China or Russia.\nThe revelation that Snowden got access to some of the material he leaked by using colleagues' passwords surfaced as the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill intended in part to tighten security over U.S. intelligence data.\nOne provision of the bill would earmark a classified sum of money - estimated as less than $100 million - to help fund efforts by intelligence agencies to install new software designed to spot and track attempts to access or download secret materials without proper authorization.\nThe bill also requires that the Director of National Intelligence set up a system requiring intelligence contractors to quickly report to spy agencies on incidents in which data networks have been penetrated by unauthorized persons.\n(Editing by Alistair Bell and Paul Simao)\n", "comments": []}
