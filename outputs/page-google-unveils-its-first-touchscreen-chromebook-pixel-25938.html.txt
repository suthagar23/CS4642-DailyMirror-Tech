Chrome laptops that followed were made by Acer, Lenovo and HP.\nBut so far, Chromebooks have had difficulties challenging Windows-powered computers, said CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber.\n\"Chromebooks have struggled for relevance to date, stuck between comparably-priced but entertainment-centric tablets - many of which run Android - and more functional PCs,\" he said.\n\"[The new computer] won't transform its prospects but Google will hope it serves as a flagship device that has a halo effect for the broader portfolio.\"\nWindows 8, Microsoft's latest operating system launched last year, has touchscreen capabilities.\nMr Blaber said: \"Touch is now pervasive across every computing category from phones to high-end PCs.\n\"The challenge for the Chromebook is that computing is shifting towards tablets whilst most consumers lives are not yet fully embracing the cloud versus local storage.\"\n", "comments": []}
