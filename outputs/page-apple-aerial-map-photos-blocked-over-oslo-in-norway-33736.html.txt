But they did take photos from aeroplanes,\" he said.\n\"It's easier for Norwegian operators to get licences because [the ministry] can have more control over the photos.\"\nAftenposten points out that neither the US Department of Defence in Arlington or the CIA headquarters at Langley are currently available in 3D on Apple's maps.\nA spokesman for Apple was unable to provide comment at this time.\n", "comments": []}
