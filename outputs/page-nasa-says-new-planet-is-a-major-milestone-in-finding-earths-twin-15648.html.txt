So far the mission has found more than 1,000 new candidates. But, today as part the Kepler's team's first science conference, NASA announced Kepler-22b, a special exoplanet that if found to be rocky could host life with a comfy temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit\nOf course, there are still lots of questions about Kepler-22b, but as The Guardian puts it, the exoplanet \"offers [the] best hope yet for a new Earth.\"\n)\n", "comments": [{"commentterName": "JoAnn ", "commentterTime": "Friday, 6 January 2012 00:05 ", "comment": "Im ecstatic!
