Apple unveiled its new generations of smartphones\u037e\u00a0iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus. Both models will be available to preorder on Friday, September 9th, and begin shipping a week later on September 16th.\nIn Dailymirror Tech, we ran a write up on\n, and this new operating system will ship with latest iPhone models.\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s have a look on all new shiny iPhone 7. Here\u2019s everything you need\u00a0to know about the new iPhone 7.\nThe home button has been reengineered from the ground up and it is customizable on the iPhone 7. The iPhone 7\u2019s solid state home button is now Force Touch sensitive and works together with Apple\u2019s Taptic engine to be more responsive to a wider range of frequencies.The new home button is used throughout iOS, providing unique feedback for messages,notifications, ringtones and navigation.\nApple has upgraded the iPhone\u2019s camera system with a f/1.8 aperture, sixelement lens, a larger sensor, a flash with four discrete LEDs, and a builtin flicker sensor \u2013 all of which means that the camera should take better photos, even in weird, flickering fluorescent lighting.\nBut the biggest camera improvement is exclusive to the heftier iPhone 7 Plus, which has a dual camera system that, for the first time, allows for 2x optical zoom without any loss of image quality. Switching between the two cameras is seamless: just tap the 1x or 2x button in the camera app and it switches automatically, or smoothly zoom between them using an onscreen slider.\nFor the first time, the iPhone 7 now has onboard stereo speakers \u2013 one at the top and one at\u00a0bottom of the device. Apple says this makes the sound it produces twice as loud, and\u00a0increased dynamic range means it should sound better as well. However, those speakers\u00a0are exactly where the headphone jack used to be.\nApple is notorious for being the first to drop longstanding technological standards, and this\u00a0time around it\u2019s the ubiquitous 3.5mm headphone jack. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus no longer\u00a0feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. That means you\u2019ll have to rely on a Lightning converter for\u00a0your current headphones, or upgrade to a pair of Bluetooth earbuds.\nApple will be including earpods with a lightning cable connection in the box, along with a small lightning to headphone jack adapter cable for using your standard headphones.\nThe iPhone 7 and 7 Plus utilize Apple\u2019s most powerful processor ever \u2014 the A10 Fusion. It\u2019s a 64bit\u00a0quadcore processor that\u2019s 40 percent faster than the A9 in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. Apple says it\u2019s 120 times faster than the original iPhone.\nThe battery is also the best ever compared to previous iPhones. Apple says the new iPhone 7 will last 2 hours more than the iPhone 6S, and the iPhone 7 Plus will add an additional hour over the iPhone 6S Plus. We\u2019ll just have to wait until the 16th of September to see the first teardowns that will reveal the actual battery capacity.\n", "comments": [{"commentterName": "kukula ", "commentterTime": "Thursday, 8 September 2016 14:32 ", "comment": "All this at what price?", "thumpDown": "3", "thumpUp": "5"}]}
