It is being adopted by big companies and governments globally to cut costs and give flexibility to their IT departments.\nSnowden's leaks revealing the reach and methods of U.S. surveillance have prompted angry calls for explanations from France to Brazil. Germany has been particularly annoyed by revelations that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nWales said the revelations made it more difficult to convince oppressive regimes to respect basic freedoms and privacy as Wikipedia seeks to limit censorship of its content.\n\"They (spying revelations) give the Chinese every excuse to be as bad as they have been... It's really embarrassing,\" he said. \"It's an enormous problem, an enormous danger.\"\nChina and countries in the Middle East have been most active in filtering Wikipedia content to restrict access to certain information, Wales said.\nHe said Wikipedia had no plan to introduce advertising.\n\"If we need to do that to survive, we will do what's needed to survive, but we are not discussing that,\" he said. \"Some places have to remain free of commerce... Wikipedia is a temple for the mind,\" Wales said.\nWikipedia has been financed through a non-profit foundation Wikimedia, which reported revenues of $38.4 million for the fiscal year 2011-2012, including $35.1 million in donations and contributions.\n(Editing by Gareth Jones)\n", "comments": []}
