Numbers of users of the site increased on daily basis. But, just because it has become famous doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll always bring us good. Here are some of the top mistakes Sri Lankans make when it comes to using Facebook. Let\u2019s identify them and make the social network site to work for us, not vice versa.\nJust because we have a medium to reach out our friends and family, doesn\u2019t mean we need constantly knocking their doors to tell what are we going to eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner? Do you really need to tell everybody what you ate for lunch? No, you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t share such trivial details to add value to people\u2019s lives. When you\u2019re on Facebook, you\u2019re doing it, because you think you\u2019re lonely and desperate for approval. It\u2019s time to curate what you share on Facebook.\nAs soon as you have a notification on your phone or laptop or PC, you have the urge to look up the notification and act upon it. But, here is the thing, devices are just machines they work on the electricity supply, and you think you should be act as a machine in order to be connected always and responding to everything and anything. Remember, you\u2019re a human,\u00a0not a robot.\nYes, you are afraid of missing out. You\u2019ll miss out on things, but it may not be that big of a deal. Facebook destructs your focus by hunting on your fear of missing out (FOMO). You check your feed while you talk with your partner, because you don\u2019t want to miss any interesting updates. You check your messages while you drive, because a friend might have something exciting to share. Let\u2019s face it, Facebook feed will be there forever, if you want to see it. But think about the moment you lose by checking something on Facebook in an inappropriate time. You should be driving carefully, not checking feed and crash your car\u00a0and die. Think about it.\nYou think that constantly scrolling the Facebook feed is very much important than savouring your lunch or studying for the exam. You seem to have an excuse not to do an important work, just for the sake of checking and scrolling the Facebook. You don\u2019t want to be in present moment involving in discussion with your partner in real world, but to check for something on Facebook for no reason. Remember this, Facebook can be used as your companion, with carefully curated way. If you\u2019re not curating how your use Facebook and it\u2019ll be the main enemy for your productivity and purpose.\nYou know what Dunbar\u2019s number is, right? Yes, that\u2019s right. 150 \u2013 and this is the number ofmpeople with whom we can maintain a meaningful relationship, whether in a huntergatherer society or on Facebook. But we think we should be friends with thousands of people and in stay in touch with them. That\u2019s totally impossible and our brains just aren't big enough to cope with it. Let\u2019s be honest - you talk to your closest friends in other ways besides posting on their wall. Your real friends will still be there even if you stop using Facebook,you\u2019ll just communicate in different ways \u2014 text, phone call or emails. No matter what, your\nreal friends will still stay in touch.\nSo those are the top mistakes, but don\u2019t fret, well, there is a good news, these can beovercome with your tention to get rid of this Facebook addiction, that drains your time and\nenergy.\nSimple solution is: Use Facebook mindfully.\nUsing Facebook without mindfully, you will become a person of less concentration,comparing yourself to others, losing sense of reality, more stress and loss of free time withreal people who matter in your real life.It\u2019s all about choice. Choose wisely.
