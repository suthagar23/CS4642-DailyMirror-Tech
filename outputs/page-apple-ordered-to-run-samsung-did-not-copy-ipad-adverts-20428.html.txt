The overall impression produced is different.\"\nHowever, the judge refused Samsung's request that Apple be forbidden from restating its claim that its design rights had been infringed.\nJudge Birss said that the US firm was \"entitled\" to hold the opinion that his judgement was wrong.\nA statement from Samsung said: \"Should Apple continue to make excessive legal claims based on such generic designs, innovation in the industry could be harmed and consumer choice unduly limited.\"\n", "comments": []}
