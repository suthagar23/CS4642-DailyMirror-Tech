But that may be cold comfort to those wary of the secret court with which the NSA deals, as well as the security agency's perceived lack of forthrightness with lawmakers regarding its activities.\nThe NSA's apparent ability to easily sidestep encryption \"moves spying from somewhat difficult to trivial,\" Eva Galperin, a Global Policy Analyst with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET.\nGalperin also said the NSA's tools could wind up in the hands of others. \"We lose our security not just from the NSA,\" she said, \"but from other actors who could subvert\" the back doors and so on for which the agency is responsible.\nThe Times says intelligence officials asked the paper and ProPublica not to publish information on the NSA's decryption efforts because that would tip off foreign targets as to what sorts of communications might be more safe from surveillance. The Times says it \"decided to publish the article because of the value of a public debate about government actions that weaken the most powerful tools for protecting the privacy of Americans and others.\" ProPublica has also posted a statement about the decision to publicize the NSA's efforts. We have an e-mail in to the NSA and will update this piece when we have more information.\nThe documents provided by Snowden don't specify which tech companies have been involved with the NSA's effort to foil encryption, and the Times report says that \"the full extent of the N.S.A.'s decoding capabilities is known only to a limited group of top analysts from the so-called Five Eyes: the N.S.A. and its counterparts in Britain, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\"\nThe Times notes that \"by introducing such back doors, the N.S.A. has surreptitiously accomplished what it had failed to do in the open,\" and it points to the debate in the '90s over the \"Clipper Chip,\" which would have handed the NSA a key to any digital encryption technologies. The Clipper Chip idea was abandoned after a backlash from varied politicos, tech execs, and rights groups.\n", "comments": []}
