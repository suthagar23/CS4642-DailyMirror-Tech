The banks have committed to the financing which is expected be split evenly among the four, two people said.\nINCREASING PRESSURE\nThe news that the two sides are nearing a final agreement follows years of speculation as to when and whether Vodafone, the world's second largest mobile operator, would exit the highly successful business.\nVodafone entered the United States in 1999 through a series of deals that resulted in the formation of Verizon Wireless in 2000, with Verizon Communications holding 55 percent of the company and Vodafone the rest.\nBut the two sides clashed almost immediately and the partnership has over the years been fraught with difficulties, with both partners at times seeking to buy out the other in times of weakness.\nVerizon at one point withheld dividends from Vodafone for six years in an effort to force the British group out of the company, a stance that was first resisted by Arun Sarin who led the company from 2003 to 2008 and then by current boss Vittorio Colao.\nTheir resistance, often in the face of investor demands for a sale, may prove to have been a masterstroke. Verizon Wireless became the largest operator in the U.S., a growing market that boasts high margins and high prices compared with Europe.\nFor Verizon, a deal means it no longer has to share the billions in cash generated by Verizon Wireless and will in the long run be better able to compete in a country that looks set to turn more competitive.\n", "comments": []}
