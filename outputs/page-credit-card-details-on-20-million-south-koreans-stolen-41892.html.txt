The contractor stole the data by copying it to a USB stick.\nRegulators are now looking into security measures at the three firms - KB Kookmin Card, Lotte Card, and NH Nonghyup Card - to ensure data stays safe. A task force has been set up to investigate the impact of the theft.\nThe three bosses of the credit card firms involved made a public apology for the breach.\nIn a statement the Financial Services Commission, Korea's national financial regulator, said: \"The credit card firms will cover any financial losses caused to their customers due to the latest accident.\"\nAnother official at the FSC said the data was easy to steal because it was unencrypted and the credit card firms did not know it had been copied until investigators told them about the theft.\nThis theft of consumer data is just the latest to hit South Korea. In 2012, two hackers were arrested for getting hold of the details of 8.7 million subscribers to KT Mobile. Also, in 2011, details of more than 35 million accounts of South Korean social network Cyworld were exposed in an attack.\n", "comments": []}
