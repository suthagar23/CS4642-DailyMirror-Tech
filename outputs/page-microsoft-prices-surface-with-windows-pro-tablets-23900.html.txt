Neither price includes one of Microsoft's keyboards, which add at least another $99.\nOne industry watcher noted that the new computer would face more competition due to the fact more Window 8-powered computers have been announced than Windows RT ones by other manufacturers.\n\"The Intel-based version of Windows 8 is far more attractive to the market than the Windows RT version as consumers today can't ignore the fact that they may just be a version of a program that they want to run built on the old architecture which the ARM-based version doesn't support,\" Ken Dulaney, a mobile technology analyst at consultants Gartner, told the BBC.\n\"But there will be a lot of other Windows 8 hybrids out there that also allow their screens to be detached from their keyboards.\n\"So I'd suggest that buyers sit back and wait for other products which may be even more compelling or cheaper and not become too fixated on what is a first-generation Microsoft device.\"\n", "comments": []}
