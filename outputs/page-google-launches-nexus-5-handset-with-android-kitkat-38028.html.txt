Its camera also has a rapid burst system that captures several photographs at the same time so owners can pick the best shot.\nThe handset is due to go on sale on 1 November in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and Korea.\n\"Nexus devices serve an important function for Google,\" said Ben Wood, head of research at analyst firm CCS Insight.\n\"The company collaborates closely with the chosen phone maker as it rolls out a new version of the Android operating system and this results in a 'vanilla' version of the software that acts as a reference platform for developers and tech enthusiasts.\"\nGoogle said a base 16GB version of the device would cost $349 in the US (\u00a3299 in the UK), unlocked and without a contract. The 32GB version should cost $399 (\u00a3339 in the UK).\nWith Android Kitkat, Google said it had made the software use less memory so it could be used on handsets with much lower specifications than top end smartphones.\nIn addition, Google has begun moving some services off Android's core software and onto its app store. Many see this as a way for it to maintain more control over the security of the software and its associated applications.\n", "comments": []}
