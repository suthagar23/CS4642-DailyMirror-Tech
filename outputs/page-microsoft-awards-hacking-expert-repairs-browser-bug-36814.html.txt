He was awarded a large bounty from Hewlett-Packard Co for identifying a way to \"pwn,\" or take ownership of, Oracle Corp's Java software in a high-profile contest known as Pwn2Own (pronounced \"pown to own\").\nMicrosoft also released an automatic update to Internet Explorer on Tuesday afternoon to fix a security bug that it first disclosed last month.\nResearchers say hackers initially exploited that flaw to launch attacks on companies in Asia in an operation that the cybersecurity firm FireEye has dubbed DeputyDog.\nMarc Maiffret, chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust, said the vulnerability was later more broadly used after Microsoft's disclosure of the issue brought it to the attention of cyber criminals.\nHe is advising computer users to immediately install the update to Internet Explorer, if they do not have their PCs already set to automatically download updates.\n\"Any time they patch something that has already been used (to launch attacks) in the wild, then it is critical to apply the patch,\" Maiffret said.\nThat vulnerability in Internet Explorer was known as a \"zero-day\" because Microsoft, the targeted software maker, had zero days notice to fix the hole when the initial attacks exploiting the bug were discovered.\nIn an active, underground market for \"zero day\" vulnerabilities, criminal groups and governments sometimes pay $1 million or more to hackers who identify such bugs.\n(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Richard Chang)\n", "comments": []}
