It sought $519m in damages from Apple.\nAt the time of the original ruling Samsung said the decision was bad news for consumers and would \"lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices\".\nApple said it applauded the court \"for finding Samsung's behaviour wilful and for sending a loud clear message that stealing isn't right\".\nEven after this latest trial, which will involve a new jury, both companies could appeal.\n\"I think they will appeal unless they settle,\" intellectual property consultant Florian Mueller told the BBC.\n\"But at this point neither party has enough leverage to force someone into settling if they don't want to. And we're not there yet,\" he said.\nApple has asked for a sales ban to be imposed on the Samsung products that had been found to infringe the patents. But the judge ruled that Apple could adequately be compensated financially.\n\"Between these types of big players a $1bn damages award is not as bad as a sales ban,\" said Mr Mueller.\nApple appealed against that ruling and the result of the appeal is due before the end of the year.\nSamsung and Apple are currently locked in a battle in the courts of more than 10 countries across Europe.\nBut some senior technology experts believes the legal conflict is bad for consumers.\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak told the BBC recently that: \"There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone; I wish Apple would use them, and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us.\n\"I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology; all our products would be better, we'd go further.\n\"I do kind of wish they were more compatible.\"\nIn October, Samsung offered to stop taking rivals to court in Europe over alleged infringements of certain types of patents for a period of five years.\nThe European Union authorities had said the South Korean company's litigious actions were stifling competition. Samsung faced a potential \u00a311.3bn ($18.3bn) fine if found guilty of breaching European anti-trust laws.\n", "comments": []}
