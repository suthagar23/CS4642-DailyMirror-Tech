Apple has accused Samsung of copying the design and function of some of its tablet and smartphone devices, while Samsung has counter-sued Apple for allegedly breaching patents related to wireless transmission technology. A U.S. Federal Court began its own high profile case last week.\nThe hot tub approach temporarily switches Australia's adversarial court system into more of an inquisitorial system that is widely followed in Europe and Asia.\n\"The basic theory is that if an expert is in a position like that ... they will be more upfront about what they really think and they'll be more willing to discuss the nuances of points,\" said Summerfield. \"It also tempers the tendency of barristers to be aggressive in questioning.\"\n(Reporting By Jane Wardell; Editing by Nick Macfie)\n", "comments": []}
