Dual cooling allows maximum cooling at all times and it has up to 10 hours and six minutes of battery life with NVIDIA Optimus technology that maximizes battery life for extended productivity.\nThe M3800 also enables editing video at a shoot, presenting CAD ideas to customers in style or rendering 3D animation and modelling on the road.\nDell Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives Lakshmindra Fernando cited an example of a normal motor car versus a Formula 1 (F1) racing car to explain the difference between an average PC and a workstation.\n\u201cThe F1 car is built and designed for a particular purpose and that is to race, whereas a normal motor car is meant for day-to-day use. Likewise, a workstation is designed for a specific purpose and delivers high performance for specialized customers,\u201d he said.\nFernando further stated that as the traditional workplace continues to evolve, Dell\u2019s workstation customers are requiring more and more portable systems but cannot afford to sacrifice performance for their critical software applications.\n\u201cWith the introduction of the M3800 we\u2019ve not only delivered on customer requests but set a new standard for mobile workstations with the thinnest form factor, outstanding performance and highest resolution QHD+ display for designing, creating and collaborating with clients while in the office or on the road,\u201d he said.\nThe M3800 will be priced at a starting price of Rs.350,000 but according to Fernando, the price would be much less depending on customer requirements and configurations.\nTuned and optimized for the top media and entertainment, engineering and design applications such as those in Adobe Creative Cloud, Autodesk Entertainment Creation Suit and AutoCAD, Inventor and Revit, Avid Media Composer, DassaultCatia and Solidworks, PTC Creo, Siemens NX and TeamCenter, among others, the M3800 assures mission critical applications will run as designed and come with optional Dell ProSupport for premium 24/7 global support from expert technicians.\n", "comments": []}
