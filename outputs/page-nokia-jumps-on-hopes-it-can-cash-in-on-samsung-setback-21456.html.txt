Microsoft's European-listed shares were 1.6 percent higher.\nNokia and its software partner Microsoft have been struggling to win ground from Samsung's Android-powered smartphones which lead the market.\nGoogle's Android is used in around 65 percent of smartphones sold globally, with Samsung the biggest maker of Android phones.\nNokia has been fighting for survival after losing vast ground to Apple and Samsung. In 2011 it forged a software alliance with Microsoft, which had also fallen behind in smartphone software.\nNokia is now the largest maker of Windows Phones, but the market share of the software has stayed at below 5 percent.\n\"We think that the real winner hear will be Microsoft and the Windows Phone ecosystem,\" Nomura analysts said in a note.\n\"As Android and Apple tear each other apart, Microsoft has been waiting in the wings and is in a very good position to move in and entice users to switch from Android to Microsoft, as we have already seen that user loyalty is low,\" they said.\nNokia is expected to launch its first smartphones using a new version of Windows Phone software at an industry event in early September.\n(Reporting by Tarmo Virki; Editing by David Holmes and Mark Potter)\n", "comments": []}
