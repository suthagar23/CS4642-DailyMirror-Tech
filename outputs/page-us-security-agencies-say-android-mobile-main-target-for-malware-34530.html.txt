DHS declined to comment.\nBy comparison, about 19 percent of malware attacks were targeted at Nokia's Symbian system and less than 1 percent each at Apple Inc's iOS software, Microsoft Corp's Windows and BlackBerry Ltd.\nAndroid continues to be a \"primary target for malware attacks due to its market share and open source architecture,\" said the study, which was addressed to police, fire, emergency medical and security personnel.\n(Reporting By Poornima Gupta.
