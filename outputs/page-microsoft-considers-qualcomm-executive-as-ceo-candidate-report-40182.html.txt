Mulally is credited with rescuing the beleaguered auto giant, but sources said an external tech executive is in the running, plus one or two internal executives.\nMicrosoft declined comment on its CEO search, and Qualcomm declined comment on Mollenkopf's potential candidacy.\nPeople familiar with the process expect Microsoft to select a new CEO before the end of the year, although the committee formed to find Ballmer's successor gave itself 12 months to do its work when it was formed in August.\nMulally, who helped Ballmer create his 'One Microsoft' overhaul and has seemed so far to be the most likely candidate to succeed him, is under pressure this week from Ford's board to clarify his plans.\n\"I love serving Ford,\" Mulally told Reuters on Thursday, without addressing the speculation surrounding him.\nMollenkopf, an engineer who holds several wireless patents and has risen to the top management ranks at Qualcomm since joining the company in 1994, appears to meet the requirements of the Microsoft CEO job laid out by Chairman Bill Gates last month.\nAccording to Gates, Microsoft needs a CEO who can run a \"complex global business\" and \"work with our top technical talent.\"\n(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)\n", "comments": []}
