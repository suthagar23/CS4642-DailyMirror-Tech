According to the company\u2019s official response, \u201cno sensitive user data was exposed and Viber\u2019s databases were not \u2018hacked\u2019.\u201d\nThe company did not confirm whether the attack came from the Syrian Electronic Army, though the hacker group does take responsibility for the hack. Viber did, however, claim that the hack was the product of a phishing attack that was carried out against one of their employees.\nThe hack took down the Viber support page, and replaced it with the following message and a screenshot of the hack.\n", "comments": []}
