We're relying on your input to help us continually improve the Instagram experience.\"\nInstagram is the latest social media network to turn to advertising to capitalize on its millions of users. Advertisers are projected to spend close to $10 billion on social network ads worldwide this year, according to research firm eMarketer.\nWorldwide spending on mobile advertising, which could fit nicely with Instagram since people use the app on the go, is forecast by eMarketer to reach $8.8 billion this year.\nWhen Facebook acquired Instagram last year, it paid an eye-popping $1 billion in cash for the app-maker, which had scant revenue.\nFacebook too has been ramping up its efforts to seize more ad dollars especially those earmarked for smartphones and other mobile devices.\n(Reporting by Jennifer Saba in New York.
