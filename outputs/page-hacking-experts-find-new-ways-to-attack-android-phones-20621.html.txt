When an Android user walks by, the phone would get infected, said Miller.\nHe spent five years as a global network exploit analyst at the U.S. National Security Agency, where his tasks included breaking into foreign computer systems.\nMiller and another hacking expert, Georg Wicherski of CrowdStrike, have also infected an Android phone with a piece of malicious code that Wicherski unveiled in February.\nThat piece of software exploits a security flaw in the Android browser that was publicly disclosed by Google's Chrome browser development team, according to Wicherski.\nGoogle has fixed the flaw in Chrome, which is frequently updated, so that most users are now protected, he said.\nBut Wicherski said Android users are still vulnerable because carriers and device manufacturers have not pushed those fixes or patches out to users.\nMarc Maiffret, chief technology officer of the security firm BeyondTrust, said: \"Google has added some great security features, but nobody has them.\"\nExperts say iPhones and iPads don't face the same problem because Apple has been able to get carriers to push out security updates fairly quickly after they are released.\nTwo Trustwave researchers told attendees about a technique they discovered for evading Google's \"Bouncer\" technology for identifying malicious programs in its Google Play Store.\nThey created a text-message blocking application that uses a legitimate programming tool known as java script bridge. Java script bridge lets developers remotely add new features to a program without using the normal Android update process.\nCompanies including Facebook and LinkedIn use java script bridge for legitimate purposes, according to Trustwave, but it could also be exploited maliciously.\nTo prove their point, they loaded malicious code onto one of their phones and remotely gained control of the browser. Once they did that, they could force it to download more code and grant them total control.\n\"Hopefully Google can solve the problem quickly,\" said Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs. \"For now, Android is the Wild West.\"\n(Editing by Paul Tait)\n", "comments": []}
