A final hurdle was cleared last week when European regulators approved the deal.\nSkype's voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services let people hold free video and voice calls over the Internet; Skype charges a fee for \"SkypeOut,\" which lets Skype users dial ordinary phone numbers, and \"SkypeIn, which lets people dial an ordinary phone number that actually connects through to a Skype account online. Both services are useful for bypassing steep international calling rates using conventional telephone service.\nIn July, Skype had 65 million daily users, the company said last month. Collectively, they spent 700 million minutes a day on Skype audio calls, 300 million minutes a day on Skype video calls, and 30 million minutes a day on calls with ordinary phones.\nSkype CEO Tony Bates now is president of Microsoft's Skype Division.\nSkype products will be integrated into Microsoft products, but they'll continue to be offered where they are today, Microsoft said. Skype apps are available for iOS and Android, which compete with Windows Phone, and on Mac OS and Linux, which compete with Windows.\nBates expects Skype growth to increase under Microsoft.\n\"Together, we will be able to accelerate Skype's goal to reach one billion users daily,\" Bates said in a statement.\nSkype was founded in 2003, and eBay acquired it in 2005. An investor group led by Silver Lake Partners bought it in 2009. Skype also has an important partnership with Facebook that could help each company compete better with rival online services such as Google+ \"hangouts,\" Yahoo Messenger, and Gmail Chat.\n", "comments": []}
