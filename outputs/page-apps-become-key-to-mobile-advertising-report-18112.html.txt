Google also has a thriving app store for its Android phones.\nAt first it seemed that most developers would have a hard time making enough money from their small software programs, which were made for anything from playing games to checking the weather or recognizing songs.\nBut advertisers are now increasingly using them to reach the consumers of those apps. Strategy Analytics estimates that advertisers will spend $2.9 billion on in-app advertising this year, while consumers will spend $26.1 billion buying them.\nThe number of apps downloaded globally is expected to grow 38 percent to more than 32 billion this year.\n\"Advertisers chase eyeballs, so the fact that brands spend more on in-app advertising than the mobile Web is a clear sign that apps are what consumers are glued to for an increasing range of activities,\" said David MacQueen, the firm's director of wireless media strategies.\nIn less affluent economies, consumers tend to use more basic phones that may not have access to app stores, but browse the Web instead.\nFigures from InMobi, the world's largest independent mobile ad network, confirm that mobile advertising is taking off, after grappling for years with the small screen size and perceived invasions of privacy on phones.\nIn a report to be published on Monday, InMobi says the number of ads seen by consumers on mobile phones grew 21 percent in January-March over the previous quarter to 283 billion.\n", "comments": []}
