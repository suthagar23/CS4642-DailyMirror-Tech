I don't know how else to describe it.\"\nPlunkett's comments from the normally tight-lipped NSA reflect a growing concern among U.S. officials, lawmakers and agency heads about the country's cyber security.\nSecurity software maker Symantec Corp said on Friday that a hacker group that attacked Google Inc in 2009 - an operation later dubbed Operation Aurora - had since launched hundreds of other cyber assaults, focusing on defense companies and human rights groups.\nCybersecurity experts widely believe the Google attacks originated from China. Chinese officials have denied their country is a source of cyber attacks against the United States\nSymantec said the group had used a technique that enabled attackers to hack into highly secured systems. That suggested the hackers were either a large criminal group, backed by a nation-state, or a nation-state itself, Symantec said.\nIn July, General Keith Alexander, head of the NSA, said during an interview at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado, that the number of computer attacks from hackers, criminal gangs and foreign nations on American infrastructure had increased 17-fold from 2009 to 2011.\n\"The trend exists and we have to be prepared for it and think that it will only get worse because I believe that it will,\" Plunkett said.\nU.S. lawmakers in August stalled cyber legislation that would enable companies and the government to share information about hacking and create a set of voluntary cybersecurity standards for companies in charge of critical infrastructure like energy, water and transportation.\nWith the Nov 6 congressional and presidential elections looming, observers say cyber security will be overshadowed by issues like taxes and spending.\n\"I am thrilled that the conversation is happening. Am I disappointed that we're not there? Sure ... I predict we're going to have legislation. It will happen ... and I'm also pretty convinced that one year after it happens, we'll think it's not enough,\" Plunkett said.\n(Editing by Warren Strobel and Peter Cooney)\n", "comments": []}
