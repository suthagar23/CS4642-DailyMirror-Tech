We knew the day would come.\"\nSequoia is 1.55 times faster than the Fujitsu model, and uses over 1.5 million processors.\nIn comparison the Japanese model has less than half the number of CPUs (central processing units).\nThe IBM supercomputer is also more energy efficient than the Fujitsu model.\nSequoia consumes 7.9 megawatts compared to the K computer which uses 12.6 megawatts.\nMr Turek described Sequoia as the \"pinnacle of energy efficiency\" and said the reaction had been \"very enthusiastic.\"\n\"Government laboratories in Europe have already expressed interest,\" he said.\nThe list is published every six months by German Professor Hans Meuer and US-based Professor Jack Dongarra.\nProf Dongarra told the BBC it was unlikely that another manufacturer would overtake IBM in the next year.\n\"Sequoia is very impressive,\" he said.\nThe first computer to take the top position on the list was the CM-5/1024 in 1993, designed by Thinking Machines.\nAccording to Prof Dongarra, Sequoia is 273,930 times faster.\n\"A calculation that took three full days to compute on the Thinking Machines in 1993 today can be done in less than one second on the Sequoia,\" he said.\n", "comments": []}
