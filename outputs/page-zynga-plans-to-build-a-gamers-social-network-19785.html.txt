The two companies also confirmed recently that Facebook has begun showing ads from its inventory inside Zynga games, which are played by some 290 million people.\nMeanwhile, Facebook's reach of close to 1 billion users has helped distribute Zynga's games and propel the publisher to a dominant position in the social gaming industry, but analysts have warned that Zynga needs to seek greater independence to sustain growth, especially as Facebook's expansion inevitably slows.\nColin Sebastian, an analyst at R. W. Baird, said the Zynga with Friends network \"is a natural step in the right direction as they leverage their technology infrastructure and user base. On one hand it might help them become less dependent on Facebook, but from a practical perspective they will continue to remain dependent on Facebook for quite some time.\"\nAsked to comment, Facebook issued a statement that betrayed no concern about Zynga's announcement. \"It's exciting to see Zynga continue to build with Facebook across web and mobile platforms.\"\nResponding to questions from reporters on Tuesday, Zynga executives took pains to stress that the expansion of its own social network did not threaten its existing relationship with Facebook.\n\"We've had a longstanding agreement with Facebook that we would do these kinds of things,\" said Reed Shaffner, Zynga's director of product. \"In no way are we trying to use that to say you have to play on this platform.\"\n\"The idea is that we'll help you find the best gaming friends anywhere you play,\" he added.\nExecutives said the platform could potentially have as many as 290 million users with some 2.8 billion daily social interactions once it is rolled out, although a launch date was not specified.\nZynga acknowledged on Tuesday that it is also trying to boost mobile usage, targeting a small but faster-growing wireless device gaming market that is quickly becoming a crucial battleground for so-called casual or social gaming.\nTo bolster its mobile offerings, Zynga purchased New York-based game developer OMGPOP for $183 million in March.\nThe company said Tuesday it will also team up with Atari SA to develop games, but did not elaborate.\nZynga executives said they will provide developers a set of \"application programming interfaces\" - APIs - to make it easier for them to craft games using Zynga's software.\n\"We're opening our doors today and opening Zynga Partners for Mobile. We are inviting developers from all over the world to come and join our network,\" said David Ko, chief mobile officer.\nZynga wants to create an ecosystem with \"best-in-class mobile developers and best-in-class mobile games,\" Ko said.\nThe company also announced new titles including ChefVille, a kitchen management game, and The Ville, a game resembling \"The Sims\" that allows users to build homes and dress their avatars to interact and pursue romantic relationships with other users.\nEven so, analysts said Zynga, facing mounting scrutiny from investors, may need to look beyond its familiar repertoire to attract new gamers and keep existing ones hooked.\n\"One area where they may have disappointed people is, they are not showing any games in development that target a more core gamer, or so-called mid-core gamer,\" said Sebastian, the Baird analyst. \"That's something where we've seen a lot of growth for Facebook, and that's potentially a missed opportunity for Zynga.\"\n(Editing by Edwin Chan, Tim Dobbyn and Andre Grenon)\n", "comments": []}
