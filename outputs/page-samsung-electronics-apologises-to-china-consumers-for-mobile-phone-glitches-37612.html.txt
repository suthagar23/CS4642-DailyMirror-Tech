In a 25-minute programme broadcast late on Monday, CCTV said internal multimedia cards cause the software on Samsung Electronics Note and S series smartphones to seize up.\nSamsung Electronics said it will fix the Galaxy S3 and Note2 telephones free of charge, and refund customers who already paid for repairs to the devices at authorised service centers. The company also will offer replacements or refunds for phones that could not be repaired.\nThe broadcast on Samsung Electronics came the day after CCTV aired a programme criticising Starbucks Corp for charging higher prices in China than other markets.\nIn March, CCTV criticised Apple Inc, the world's second-biggest smartphone maker, for using different warranty and customer service polices in China than in other countries. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook later apologised.\n(Reporting by Matthew Miller; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)\n", "comments": []}
