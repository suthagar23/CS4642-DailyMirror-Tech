The program is initially available in the United States, Japan and Korea and will be expanded to other countries.\nCraig Fugate, the FEMA administrator, said the service was at the cutting edge of disaster management in the age of smartphones.\n\"Today we have a two-way street \u2014 residents are informed about hazards in real time and emergency managers receive immediate feedback on the consequences of a disaster,\" Fugate said in a statement.\nThe program reflects the evolution of Twitter from its earliest days, when it gained a reputation as a hangout for geeks to share the minute details of their most recent meal or who they encountered at the South by Southwest Festival.\nBut the crowd-sourced information of today's Twitter has also proved problematic.\nEven as the New York City Fire Department used Twitter to communicate with residents during Hurricane Sandy, there were pranksters who spread misinformation on the service, including a rumor that the New York Stock Exchange was submerged underwater.\nAnd in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing, the name of a missing Brown University student went viral on Twitter after many users, including journalists, mistakenly identified him as a suspect.\nTwitter, for its part, has maintained a strictly hands-off attitude toward monitoring its content and denied responsibility for ensuring its accuracy.\nEarlier this month, Twitter filed with regulators for an initial public offering. Reuters reported last week that Twitter was in talks looking to add additional banks to its underwriting syndicate.\n(Reporting by Gerry Shih)\n", "comments": []}
