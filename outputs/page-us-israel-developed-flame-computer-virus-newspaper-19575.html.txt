It was designed to provide intelligence to help in a cyber campaign against Iran's nuclear program, involving the National Security Agency, the CIA and Israel's military, the Post said.\nThe cyber campaign against Iran's nuclear program has included the use of another computer virus called Stuxnet that caused malfunctions in Iran's nuclear enrichment equipment, the newspaper said.\nCurrent and former U.S. and Western national security officials confirmed to Reuters that the United States played a role in creating the Flame virus.\nSince Flame was an intelligence \"collection\" virus rather than a cyberwarfare program to sabotage computer systems, it required less-stringent U.S. legal and policy review than any U.S. involvement in offensive cyberwarfare efforts, experts told Reuters.\nThe CIA, NSA, Pentagon, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.\nFlame is the most complex computer spying program ever discovered.\nTwo leading computer security firms - Kaspersky Lab and Symantec Corp - have linked some of the software code in the Flame virus to the Stuxnet computer virus, which was widely believed to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program.\n(Reporting By Mark Hosenball; Editing by Philip Barbara)\n", "comments": []}
