Don't try to update your main iPhone or iDevices just yet\u00a0though, since this is still a build in progress and your phone may be sometimes act weird\u00a0and buggy.\u00a0And speaking of latest and greatest iOS features, let\u2019s take a look at the best 8 new features\u00a0Apple added in iOS 10.So, let\u2019s go.\nI know you hate all that stocks app and some other builtin\u00a0apps. No matter how hard you\u00a0hate those apps, you can\u2019t get rid of them, until now. In iOS 10, you can finally remove most\u00a0of Apple's builtin\u00a0apps.\nUpdated user interface that gives easier access to Night Shift mode and comes with\u00a0additional screen for Music and Home controls. Shh.. Now you can change the intensity of\u00a0your flashlight. In iOS 10, the flashlight button comes with different intensity settings.\nApple adding advanced face and object recognition in iOS 10 as Photos now uses the facial\nrecognition to sort photos of a certain person.\nIn iOS 10, Photos group together people, locations and other information to bring collections\u00a0of photos without any user interventions. These smart collection called as \u2018Memories\u2019. The\u00a0iPhone will automatically create video slideshows of memories for beautiful reflections and\u00a0reviews of your favourite moments.\nWith the new iOS 10, you can send handful of different animated text such as lasers and\u00a0fireworks. iMessage chats will become more expressive, with text bubbles that animate and\u00a0move, and downloadable stickers that can be sent and stuck to images within the chat.\nWith rich links, you will be able to view articles and videos right inside the messages, without\nthe need to launch a browser or separate app. Pretty cool, huh?\nFor many people, Apple's alarm clock is the last thing they see before going to sleep and the\u00a0first thing when they wake up. So Apple has totally redesigned it in iOS 10. It can even give\u00a0you a headsup\u00a0when it's time to go to bed. It's sporting a new dark mode, too.\nLock screen experience has been improved in iOS 10. Lock screen interface has totally\u00a0revamped \u00a0with significantly more detailed notifications that will let you take actions without\u00a0unlocking your phone. Oh almost forgot, that legacy 'Slide to unlock' thingy is gone. It didn't\u00a0make much sense in recent years as most people simply use the TouchID fingerprint sensor.\nSo, the question is when these are coming to my iPhone? Well, the final version will be\u00a0pushed to iPhones this fall, when the iPhone 7 comes out.
