Lashes represents memes and their creators such as Keyboard Cat, Nyan Cat and Scumbag Steve, to name a few. He\u2019s also an A&R for Rebecca Black. It\u2019s a full-time gig, and he\u2019s been at it for over two years.\nAlthough this title might have been confusing a few years ago (and possibly even now, to some), the daily churn of viral culture is creeping into the mainstream. Those who create successful memes are everyday people who might not know how to represent themselves.\nLashes worked for years as an A&R in the music industry, but his meme management career started with Charlie Schmidt, a family friend and the mastermind behind Keyboard Cat. According to Lashes, Schmidt created the video in 1986, so he was surprised and overwhelmed by the amount of feedback he received when it finally hit the web\n.\nShortly after, Schmidt contacted Lashes for advice and the rest has been a fast-paced, crazy ride.\n\u201cWe were just living in this world, trying to manage something that had never been managed before, at least that we knew of,\u201d says Lashes. \u201cHalf the time we felt totally crazy and half the time we felt a little ahead of the curve. We\u2019ve tried to keep each other in good mental health over the past few years.\u201d\nWhen asked to define a meme, Lashes admits that even he can\u2019t explain it outside a 20-minute conversation.\nBut most people know what a meme is, they just don\u2019t realize there\u2019s a word for it. For example, Lashes brings up a recent conversation with a friend about Scumbag Steve. According to Lashes, the friend wasn\u2019t familiar with the name, but as soon as he saw the photo, he recognized the character as a photo that popped up frequently on his Facebook feed.\nThe job title \u201cmeme manager\u201d can\u2019t always be an easy one to describe to family and friends. Lashes recently had to explain the concept of a website to his grandmother.\n\u201cThink of it this way \u2014 remember when you first got a telephone, and all of a sudden you had a unique number and your friends could call that number and you could connect with them? You didn\u2019t have to be in the same room. That was probably super huge, it broke down this wall in order to interact with people,\u201d says Lashes, relaying the conversation with his grandmother.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the Internet is. Websites are phone lines, and if you have a domain name, then all your friends can go straight there to connect with you.\u201d\n\u201cThe first thing I would do if I had a meme come out tomorrow is try and pick up all the domains, Facebook pages and YouTube pages \u2014 any social media website, any dot-com, or dot-net you can think of,\u201d says Lashes.\nThis includes securing the name and immediately trademarking or copyrighting the digital property that you own in the process.\nLashes\u2019 main priority is making sure that you can at least prove that it\u2019s your cat that\u2019s becoming famous, even if you never want to make a penny from it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about making a ton of money off of it, necessarily, it\u2019s about doing what the creator of the content wants to do with it,\u201d says Lashes, who understands that some things are out of his control.\nMeme culture has become so fast-paced and unpredictable, and fans are quicker than ever to put their own spin on images and videos. Things get auto-tuned, Photoshopped and mashed up. Lashes says his job would never be to prevent fans from sharing their versions of memes \u2014 in fact, he admits his desk drawers are stuffed with collectables and fan art.\nLashes is more concerned with those who are trying to cash in on his client\u2019s digital property.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s a company who\u2019s trying to sell a whole bunch of t-shirts, or put [memes] into a commercial, well, you wouldn\u2019t do that to Mickey Mouse. Anything that you can\u2019t do to Mickey Mouse, you shouldn\u2019t be able to do to any of the memes of the world. It\u2019s not right that everyone is just trying to make a buck off of it,\u201d says Lashes. \u201cIt\u2019s not the Wild Wild West anymore on the Internet, and people are treating it like it is.\u201d\nContent is created with such speed and volume on the web today that it\u2019s nearly impossible to plan for a viral video \u2014 a fact that advertisers and media companies have begun to pick up on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, whoever is booking people for the TODAY Show, they\u2019re like the number one place to break memes I think,\u201d Lashes jokes. \u201cIf you can get it on Kathie Lee and Hoda\u2019s show, that\u2019s like the gold meme approval rating right there.\u201d\nBut memes are in fact becoming more mainstream, and web communities are finding the real people behind the pics, sometimes within 24 hours of their viral success.\nDistribution is part of the reason \u2014 getting content out there is no longer an issue because you can reach the masses in a few clicks through networks like Tumblr or Reddit. It\u2019s no longer about how you get your content out there, but who picks up on it that makes memes go mainstream.\n\u201cOnce you start gathering all the people from one niche, they become a huge powerful group. There are either a hundred million people who love sharing cat videos, or a hundred million of them that love causing trouble in society. It makes them much more powerful because of how fast everything\u2019s become. Things can happen faster than any structured system can put it together.\u201d\nQuick distribution methods and the growing desire for instant gratification are what fuel memes \u2014 it\u2019s also helped turn traditional music and entertainment industries upside down.\nLashes uses Justin Bieber as a prime example of what happens when you\u2019re discovered by the masses first, calling him \u201cthe Elvis of the Internet age.\u201d\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t manufactured, he manufactured himself \u2014 like a mom and pop operation,\u201d says Lashes. \u201cThat\u2019s the same way that the next Mickey Mouse or the next Bart Simpson will happen, or maybe it\u2019s already happening.\u201d\nAccording to Lashes, putting the masses in charge of what or who the next iconic character or celebrity will be could also be detrimental to major companies.\n\u201cBy the time that Disney votes on how lovable this character is that they\u2019re developing, and whether or not it\u2019s going to get approved by parents or have this weird undertone, there are going to be a hundred thousand different uploads of people trying to fill that same space with whatever they\u2019ve come up with,\u201d says Lashes.\nAt the end of the day, Lashes says it would be silly to take any predictions about the future of memes too seriously.\n\u201cOnce you start trying to predict everything that the Internet is going to do, that\u2019s when you\u2019re going to look like an idiot,\u201d says Lashes. \u201cThe Internet has a funny way of shifting gears at any given moment and it can shift in ten different gears at the same time.\u201d\n", "comments": []}
