And it announced two new iOS apps, Parallel and Contour, that make use of the Mighty and a related product, a digitally connected ruler called Napoleon that Adobe hasn't committed to bring to market.\nThe Mighty is designed to close the gap between drawing on paper and using a tablet, with a Bluetooth link to the tablet software and drawing technology that Michael Gough, Adobe's vice president of experience design, said is precise and responsive.\n\"It's kind of surprising how good it feels to get that tactile feedback while you're drawing. I think there's going to be a lot of analog in the next generation of digital tools,\" said Gough.\nThe Bluetooth link can communicate pen status information such as how much pressure an artist is exerting on it, and it also optionally links out to Adobe's Creative Cloud service. That brings network-based features such as tools that import a pen user's color-scheme ideas or elements copied to a virtual clipboard.\nThe Mighty is geared to attract the next generation of creative types -- a potentially much larger market with an Instagram-trained population willing to experiment.\n\"When you were three or four or five years old, you could draw, then one person told you your drawing was crap, and you stopped,\" Gough said. \"A number of new platforms and tools out there are convincing a generation that they're all creative. A new motivation for Adobe is to make it possible to feel creative and, in the case of Mighty, convince people that they can draw.\"\nThe Adobe Mighty and Napoleon devices are designed to work with iPads for now, but since they just work by simulating the human finger, they could work on Android devices with appropriate software.\nThe Adobe Mighty and Napoleon devices are designed to work with iPads for now, but since they just work by simulating the human finger, they could work on Android devices with appropriate software.\nAdobe has signed a partnership with Adonit, maker of the Jot tablet stylus, to make the Mighty, Gough said. One of the changes in the new version is a tip that's narrower than the original's 5-millimeter width, he said.\n\"They brought interesting technology to bear, and we brought interesting technology to bear,\" Gough said. \"They seemed very aligned [with Adobe] around the idea that hardware drives software and software drives hardware in this virtuous cycle.\"\nAdobe debuted Mighty at its Max conference in May along with the Napoleon digital ruler, which also interacts with tablet software so people can create not just straight lines but also shapes and other figures. There's no word on whether Adobe will sell Napoleon rulers too -- unlike with Mighty, there's not a ready supply of existing technology companies in the market.\nThe two new iPad apps are designed to take advantage of the hardware devices' abilities. Parallel is a drafting app, and Contour is designed to capture shapes from people's photos so they can be imported into Parallel. By releasing a software developer kit, Adobe expects others to build software that use the devices, Gough said.\n\"We'll build communities around these apps and enable other people to make apps and services like [them],\" Gough said.\nThough Adobe's devices can benefit from a Creative Cloud subscription, the company hasn't worked out what to make freely available. Such devices will work better with the $50-per-month Creative Cloud subscription, though, and Adobe hopes to see others developing hardware that takes similar advantage, Gough said.\nPricing also remains undisclosed. Higher-end digitization technology is often priced for professionals -- technology such as Wacom's tablets -- though that company seems interested in selling small tablets for creative types and has ventured into the tablet stylus market with the $99 Intuous Creative Stylus.\nThe Mighty has a variable-color LED opposite its drawing tip. It'll change to communicate different information to the user, said Geoff Dowd, the project's design leader. For example, occasional yellow pulses means the battery needs charging, blue means it'll ready to be connected over Bluetooth, and a double pulse of color confirms that its user successfully used it to copy information to a virtual clipboard.\nIt comes with a protective sheath that also serves as a USB charger. It's got an LED status light, too; it'll cycle through the rainbow spectrum when the pen becomes fully charged.\n", "comments": []}
