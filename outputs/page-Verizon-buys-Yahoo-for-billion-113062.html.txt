It is said that the deal is consists of an\nexcessive price to pay for a company that\u2019s core internet business is considered \u201cworthless\u201d\nby Wall Street.\nUnder the deal Verizon will get Yahoo\u2019s online assets including search, mail and instant\u00a0messaging, along with its ad technology. Various real estate holdings will also be included.\u00a0Verizon is building a portfolio of online content and aiming to monetize it via advertising. In\u00a0the online advertising business Verizon faces two dominant competitors: Google and\u00a0Facebook.\nAcquiring Yahoo will bring in hundreds of millions more viewers from sites like News, Sports,\nand Finance to complement Verizon\u2019s popular properties like TechCrunch and Huffington\nPost, which is acquired in last year\u2019s AOL deal and its own mobile video app, called go90. In\nthe US, comScore puts Yahoo at No. 3 among digital properties.\nEven with AOL and Yahoo assets, Verizon has a long way to go to catch up with the online\nadvertising leaders such as Google and Facebook. Verizon with AOL currently holds a mere\n1.8% of the $69 billion digital ad market in the US. Yahoo has about 3.4%. Google and\u00a0Facebook together claim about half of it.\nOver the last few years Yahoo has struggled to keep up with the changing internet\u00a0advertising landscape, with some analysts arguing that it has failed to remain relevant in\u00a0many of its core business.\nRemaining relevant is the only way to survival in this technologically advanced &\ninformationally wealth era.\n", "comments": []}
