Waze and Facebook partnered in October 2012 when Waze released its updated version that allows users to share their drive with their Facebook friends.\nThis would be Facebook\u2019s third acquisition in Israel. It bought Snaptu in 2011 for $70 million and Face.com in 2012 for $60 million.\nIn the last year, Waze tripled its user base to 45 million and in March alone, 1.5 million users downloaded the free mobile navigation app, Calcalist said.\n", "comments": []}
