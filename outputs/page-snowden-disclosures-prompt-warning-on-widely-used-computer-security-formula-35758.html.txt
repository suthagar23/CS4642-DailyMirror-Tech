It was unclear how the company could reach all the former customers of its development tools, let alone how those programmers could in turn reach all of their customers.\nDevelopers who used RSA's \"BSAFE\" kit wrote code for Web browsers, other software, and hardware components to increase their security. Random numbers are a core part of much modern cryptography, and the ability to guess what they are renders those formulas vulnerable.\nThe NSA-promoted formula was odd enough that some experts speculated for years that it was flawed by design. A person familiar with the process told Reuters that NIST accepted it in part because many government agencies were already using it.\nBut after the Times report, NIST said it was inviting public comments as it re-evaluated the formula.\n\"If vulnerabilities are found in these or any other NIST standards, we will work with the cryptographic community to address them as quickly as possible,\" NIST said on September 10.\nSnowden, who is wanted on U.S. espionage charges and is living in temporary asylum in Russia, disclosed secret NSA programs involving the collection of telephone and email data.\n(Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Eric Beech)\n", "comments": []}
