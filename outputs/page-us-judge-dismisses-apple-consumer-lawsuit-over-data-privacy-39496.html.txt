Koh in San Jose, California dismissed the case.\n\"Plaintiffs must be able to provide some evidence that they saw one or more of Apple's alleged misrepresentations, that they actually relied on those misrepresentations, and that they were harmed thereby,\" Koh said in the November 25 ruling.\nLawyers for the plaintiffs and Apple either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.\nThe case is one part of nationwide litigation Koh is overseeing that consolidates 19 related lawsuits.\nThe case is In re Apple Inc. iPhone/iPad Application Consumer Privacy Litigation, 11-md-02250, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).\n(Reporting by Casey Sullivan; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n", "comments": []}
