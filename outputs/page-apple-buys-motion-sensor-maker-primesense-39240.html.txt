Some reports said it had paid $360m (\u00a3222m).\n\"Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,\" an Apple spokesperson was quoted as saying by the Financial Times and tech blog AllThingsD.\n'Mega trend'\nThe deal comes at a time when firms are increasingly experimenting with gesture control.\nIn October 2011, Apple filed for a patent for new ways to control devices that do not involve physical contact.\nIts filing, entitled \"Real Time Video Process Control Using Gestures\", talked about allowing users to \"throw\" content - the ability to transfer it from one of the firm's products to another - using contact-free hand movements.\nAnalysts said that acquiring a firm that specialises in making motion sensor technology could help Apple offer such features.\n\"Usage of gesture-based, touch-less control of devices is one of the big mega trends in the industry right now,\" Nitin Bhat, a partner with consulting firm Frost & Sullivan told the BBC.\n\"From Apple's perspective it looks like an attempt to make its current gadgets a lot more attractive by offering such a feature on them.\n\"It could also look to incorporate this technology in future portfolio of devices which could include an Apple TV,\" he added.\nEarlier this year, PrimeSense unveiled the advances it has made in incorporating its technology in mobile devices.\nBy shrinking down the sensor used in the Kinect, the firm showed it working with a Nexus 10 at a Google developers' conference in May.\nAccording to PrimeSense, its 3D sensing technology gives digital devices \"the ability to observe a scene in three dimensions\".\nIt said that once it has observed the movements, it translates them into a \"synchronized image stream... just like humans do\".\nThe firm's technology then processes these images and translates them into information such as:\n(Source : BBC)\n", "comments": []}
