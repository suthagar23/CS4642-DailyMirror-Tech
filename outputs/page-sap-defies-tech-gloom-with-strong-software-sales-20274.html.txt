U.S. software firms Qlik Technologies and Informatica Corp as well as Indian software services provider Infosys have issued estimates below market forecasts.\nLast month, however, SAP's main peer Oracle reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profit.\nSAP is expected to publish more detailed results and to provide a full-year outlook on July 24.
