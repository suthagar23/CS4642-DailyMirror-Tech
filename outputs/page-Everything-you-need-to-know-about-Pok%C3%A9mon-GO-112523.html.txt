Unlike previous Pok\u00e9mon games, it\u2019s not for Nintendo\u2019s handheld\nconsoles\u037e it\u2019s a free download for Android and iOS devices. It also doesn\u2019t play at all like\nprevious Pok\u00e9mon games: Although the goal is still to catch \u2019em all, Pok\u00e9mon Go is an\naugmented reality game \u2014 it mixes real\u00adworld elements with the game.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon GO,\" the smartphone game that puts the adorable, animal\u00adlike Pok\u00e9mon\ncreatures into the world around you, is a pretty big deal.\nAt the time of this writing,\n. (There are few\nworkarounds that you can try to install Pok\u00e9mon Go to your mobile, but which we don\u2019t\nrecommend to do so.) Pok\u00e9mon Go originally launched in Australia and New Zealand last\nweek before eventually arriving in the US. While the game has generated a massive\nfollowing worldwide, it hasn't been officially available in Europe until today.\nGame developer Niantic Labs has experienced a variety of server issues, and has been\nactively limiting accounts and the worldwide availability of the game as a result. That's\nstarting to change, albeit slowly, and Pok\u00e9mon Go is launching in Germany today on both\nAndroid and iOS.\nAlready millions of people in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand are wandering\naround at all hours of the day, finding Pok\u00e9mon in ridiculous places, and capturing them.\nThis week, the Pok\u00e9mon Go app has broken all records, with 10 million+ downloads in the\nfirst week, exceeding Twitter in daily active users, and with higher average user time than\nFacebook, Snapchat, Instagram & WhatsApp.\nThe big thing is Pok\u00e9mon Go uses your phone\u2019s GPS and clock to decide which Pok\u00e9mon\nappear in the game. If you\u2019re at the park, more bug and grass types appear. If you\u2019re by a\nlake, more water types appear. If it\u2019s night, more nocturnal ghost and fairy types do. So\nPok\u00e9mon won\u2019t just come to you\u037e players have to traverse the real world to catch \u2019em all.\nIt turns out that there's an amazing side effect to joining the ranks of the millions now\naddicted to Pok\u00e9mon Go: better health.\nFitness tracker Jawbone UP claims that users of its fitness band who also mentioned that\nthey used Pok\u00e9mon Go logged a whopping 62.5 percent more steps this weekend compared\nto their steps taken during a normal weekend.\nIt\u2019s becoming clear that Pok\u00e9mon Go is getting more people to move around and, as a\nbyproduct, improve their health. However, despite the buzz around the game's exercise\nbenefits, no plans for a Nintendo tracker associated with the game have been announced.\nCultural phenomenon from Nintendo has brought people together. We\u2019re not just talking\nabout people encouraged to get out and exercise while chasing Pok\u00e9mon\u037e people literally\ncollide because they\u2019re distracted by the augmented reality.\nBut some players are getting a little too close to their neighbors. Virginia\u2019s Goochland\nSheriff\u2019s Office had to issue a warning to remind people that trespassing is still illegal, even if\ntheir are Pokemon hiding in someone else\u2019s home. Some people have seen their homes\novertaken by Pok\u00e9mon \u201cgyms.\u201d Players seek out these gyms to compete, turning private\nresidences into popular hangouts and giving tenants a fan club they never wanted.\nA day after it was discovered the hit game Pok\u00e9mon Go was requesting full access\npermission to a user's Google account data, developer Niantic has released a software\nupdate that resolves the security scare.\nAlthough Niantic confirmed that was not accessing the all\u00adranging data tied to a user's\nGoogle account and that no user data had been compromised \u2014 the app only accesses\nyour Google User ID and email address \u2014 many players decided to uninstall the app or use\nan alternate dummy account to prevent any possible data breach.\nDespite the security worries, Pok\u00e9mon Go has already garnered millions of downloads and\ncaused Nintendo\u2019s stock price to soar. People are spending nearly 45 minutes a day on the\napp.\nOnce Eddie Cantor said, \u201cIt takes 20 years to make an overnight success.\u201d This saying is\nvery apt for the creator of Pok\u00e9mon GO. How did John Hanke, the creator of Pok\u00e9mon GO\ncreate such a massive overnight craze?\nThe overnight success of Pok\u00e9mon Go has taken John Hanke 20 years to create.\nThroughout these 20 years, while he had a big vision of a game layer over the world, he\ndidn\u2019t know what form it would take. At every step, he just focused at his next level up. At\neach new level, he had new powers, new team members, and new items in his inventory. At\nthe end, he made the success in his endeavours.\nLet\u2019s face it: Pok\u00e9mon Go is probably the greatest game to have ever hit our phones. If you\ndon\u2019t feel that way, well, then finally there\u2019s something for you.Software developer Jamie\nFarrelly has created PokeGone \u2015 a Chrome browser extension that will block all of the\nPok\u00e9mon\u00adrelated content that\u2019s been driving you crazy lately.\n\u201cSick and tired of hearing about Pok\u00e9mon?
