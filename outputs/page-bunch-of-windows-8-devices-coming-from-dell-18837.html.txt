You'll see us introduce tablets,\" he added.\nAnd he suggests that Windows 8 touch-centric interface means that current PCs will not be a good fit.\n\"This is a transition where you generally are going to need a new PC, whether it's a tablet or an ultrabook with touch or a notebook with touch or a PC with touch or some derivative hybrid of all of the above type of products,\" he said.\nNeedless to say, Dell wants to sell you a new PC, but he may have a point because of the heavy emphasis Microsoft is placing on the Metro touch interface.\nAnd touch won't be cheap, echoing sentiment that Intel has also expressed. \"But what I can tell you is that we think that the touchscreen products will certainly cost more. They're more in the price points and price bands that we tend to operate in,\" Dell said.\nThe PC maker reported first-quarter earnings of $635 million, or 36 cents a share, on revenue of $14.42 billion, down 4 percent from a year ago.\n", "comments": []}
