The achievement could eventually lead to the mass adoption of DNA as a long-term storage medium.\nPublished Thursday in the journal Science, the experiment aimed to demonstrate the viability of storing large amounts of data on DNA molecules. Since the data is recorded on individual nucleobase pairs in the DNA strand (those adenine-guanine/cytosine-thymine pairs you may be straining to remember from high school biology), DNA can actually store more information per cubic millimeter than flash memory or even some experimental storage techs, IEEE Spectrum reports.\nThe difficulty is in the translation \u2014 both to DNA and back again (summarized in the diagram below). The researchers started with the book\u2019s content, which included the text as well as 11 images and a javascript program, and converted it to binary code. Then they assigned every 0 and 1 a nucleobase.\nAfter that came the heavy lifting: synthesizing the DNA strand, which would be 5.27 million bases long. They made the journey by splitting it into baby steps, each 96 bases long. When they were done, the book was a tiny speck of synthesized DNA that had about one-millionth the weight of a grain of sand. That\u2019s got to look pretty attractive to anyone with a Big Data problem.\nReading the DNA book was a little easier, since all that was needed was commercially available DNA-sequencing tech. After arranging the sequence, it was easy to decode it back to binary code, and then the complete book as an HTML file. The researches said the errors introduced by the entire process were minimal, just 10 bits out of 5.27 million total.\nBesides the storage density, DNA storage has two more advantages. The first is longevity; DNA lasts for thousands of years (or even millions, if it\u2019s trapped in amber). The second is future-proofing: Since DNA is the basis of all life, future societies will always have technologies available to read it (that assumes artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t exterminate or replace human society, of course).\nThere are downsides, though. There\u2019s the cost \u2014 DNA-sequencing equipment is still relatively expensive \u2014 but the data is also unchangeable once it\u2019s encoded. DNA is strictly a write-once medium.\n", "comments": []}
