Vendors are saying they can't get as many touch-based machines as they would like to meet the demand that they're seeing.\"\nRhoda Alexander, an analyst at IHS iSuppli, echoed O'Donnell's comments. \"We've talked to a number of PC makers that are having trouble obtaining touch panels and some of the vendors I've talked to said they can't keep them on the shelf,\" she said.\nAnd Microsoft has said as much. Tami Reller, chief marketing and financial officer for Windows, said last week that there are \"not enough\" touch devices on store shelves.\nTouch PCs include standard clamshell laptops with touch screens, hybrid laptop-tablets, and stand-alone tablets. Generally, touch-screen PCs are more expensive than standard non-touch laptops.\nMicrosoft's online store lists a number of tablets and hybrids (so-called convertibles) for sale, including the $499 Acer Iconia W510, $799 Asus VivoTab, and $849 HP Envy x2.\nTouch-screen laptops include the $699 Asus VivoBook, $1,299 Acer Aspire S7, $899 Sony Vaio T13, and $1,349 HP Spectre XT TouchSmart.\nIDC's O'Donnell added, however, that non-touch Windows 8 PCs are not doing so well. \"The non-touch machines are selling below expectations,\" he said. \"If high-end machines are selling better than expected. Great. But that doesn't make up for low-end volume machines.\"\n", "comments": []}
