The suggestion from both was that demand for Apple's iPhone 5 had declined, causing Apple to slow down on manufacturing orders for more devices.\nSome analysts were quick to reassure investors that the reports were simply more \"noise\" and, in fact, old news.\n\"We believe this news is not new, as we first discussed potential supply chain component cuts in our report on December 19,\" JP Morgan analyst Mark Moskowitz said in a note this morning. \"We believe the news is more noise, and we believe the stock reaction has been overdone,\" he added.\nApple reports its fiscal first-quarter 2013 results next week, the first full quarter's worth of iPhone 5 sales, a product that went on sale in September. Analysts, on average, expect the company to have sold just under 50 million iPhones in the three-month span that ended in December. However some of that is expected to be sales of the older models like the iPhone 4S and iPhone 4, which Apple continues to sell.\n", "comments": []}
