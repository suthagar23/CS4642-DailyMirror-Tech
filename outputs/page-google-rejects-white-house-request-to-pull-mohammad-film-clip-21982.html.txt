The guidelines can be viewed here\nGoogle said on Wednesday that the video was within its guidelines.\nU.S. authorities said on Friday that they were investigating whether the film's producer, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a 55-year old Egyptian Coptic Christian living in Southern California, had violated terms of his prison release. Basseley was convicted in 2010 for bank fraud and released from prison on probation last June.\n(Reporting By Gerry Shih; Editing by Toni Reinhold)\n(Source : Reuters)\n", "comments": []}
