One of Cisco's biggest rivals is China's Huawei, whose equipment has been shunned by the U.S. due to government concerns about possible Chinese espionage.\nCisco Chief Executive John Chambers told analysts on a conference call that in other countries, where the political impact was nominal, Cisco was seeing a slowdown due to macroeconomic countries.\nCisco is seen by investors as a strong indicator of the general health of the technology industry because of its broad customer base.\nIBM, which has a similarly broad base in technology services, last month reassigned the head of its growth markets unit after a surprisingly steep drop in quarterly hardware sales in China.\n\"I'm floored by the guidance,\" said Northland Capital Markets analyst Catharine Trebnick, noting that Cisco seemed to be suffering from tough competition from lower priced rivals as well as broader economic issues.\nCisco blamed a 13 percent decline in service provider revenue on a delay in router sales due to its launch of new routers, as well as a drop in sales of set-top boxes when it decided to forego less profitable contracts.\n\"The last two weeks of the last quarter was really tough,\" Chambers said.\nCisco was also hurt by domestic issues. Chambers said that, while a recent partial U.S. federal government shutdown directly cut a smaller than expected $50 million off Cisco's revenue, it also further sapped confidence among non-government customers.\nCisco shares fell to $21.51 in late trade after the company released financial targets that shocked analysts and investors. The stock closed at $23.99 on Nasdaq and had already fallen 9 percent since its last quarterly report in August.\nCisco said revenue grew only 2 percent to $12.09 billion in its fiscal first quarter ended October 26, from $11.88 billion in the year-ago quarter, below analysts' average estimate of $12.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company itself had forecast growth of 3 percent to 5 percent in the quarter.\nIt forecast a revenue decline of 8 percent to 10 percent for the second quarter and said that it was targeting a return to revenue growth in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2015.\nTo soften the blow, Cisco announced on the same day that its board had authorized up to $15 billion in additional repurchases of its common stock.\nCisco's profit dropped to $2 billion, or 37 cents per share from $2.09 billion, or 39 cents per share.\nExcluding unusual items the company earned 53 cents per share compared with Wall Street expectations of 51 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nIt said second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) would be in a range of 45 cents to 47 cents and forecast EPS of $1.95 to $2.05 for the full fiscal year 2014, which will end in October.\n(Reporting by Sinead Carew,; Editing by Christian Plumb, Richard Chang and Alex Richardson)\n", "comments": []}
