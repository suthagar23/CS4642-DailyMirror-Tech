Other manufacturers include South Korea's LG Electronics (066570.KS).\nJapan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications had aimed to kick-start the 4K TV service in 2016. That has been brought forward to July 2014, when the final match of the 2014 football World Cup is set to take place in Brazil, the Asahi report said.\nIn Japan, the development of super high-definition 8K TVs is in progress, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications plans to launch the test 8K TV broadcast in 2016, two years ahead of schedule, it said.\n(Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Paul Tait)\n", "comments": []}
