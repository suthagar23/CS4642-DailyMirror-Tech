And she said in court that she might rule on Sunday whether or to similarly put on hold the earlier injunction on the Galaxy Tab.\nApple has waged an international patent war since 2010 as it seeks to limit the growth of Google's Android system, the world's most-used mobile operating platform. Opponents of Apple say it is using patents too aggressively in a bid to stamp out competition.\nSpokeswoman Kristin Huguet reiterated her previous statement, accusing Samsung of copying the look and feel of its products.\nSamsung said in a statement that it is \"disappointed\" in the decision. \"We will take all available measures, including legal action, to ensure the Galaxy Nexus remains available to consumers,\" the statement added\nAs a condition of the injunction, Apple was ordered to post a bond of more than $95 million, to secure payment of damages sustained by Samsung should the injunction be deemed a wrongful decision later. The order shall become effective upon posting of the bond.\nThe case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, is Apple Inc v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al, 12-00630.\n(Reporting By Dan Levine and Poornima Gupta; Editing by Edwin Chan, Carol Bishopric and Richard Chang)\n", "comments": []}
