There is a large volume of literature covering the importance of website architecture with two separate perspectives, both of which are extremely important for effective website optimisation. The first perspective is focused on the user and the user requirements; the other is focused on the search engine bots and the flow of \u2018link juice\u2019 (I will explain what link juice is and its role in SEO below). As a webmaster it is imperative that you get them both spot-on. Anecdotal evidence shows that there is a direct correlation between the two. When the user experience improves, so does the distribution of \u2018link juice\u2019 and vice versa. In this post I will be focusing primarily on the flow of \u2018link juice\u2019 and how you could use your website architecture to accomplish this.\nBefore we continue, it may be worth having an understanding of how \u2018link juice\u2019 works. There are many great resources that cover this topic, but for the purposes of this post I\u2019ll provide an explanation with an analogy.\nLinks that point to your website bring along with them benefit to your site. A link to your site is similar to a vote. The benefit of all these links that point toward your site is what is known as \u2018link juice\u2019. Imagine for a moment the flow of water for the purpose of irrigation; the similitude of link juice here is that of water. Just as crops require water to grow, individual web pages require link juice to rank for search queries on search engine results pages (SERPs). The lack of water flowing into crops can result in the destruction of crops. Similarly the lack of link juice passing onto web pages can severely hinder its ability to rank and even get indexed by search engines.\nSimilarly to how farmers distribute the flow of water to all their crops, good website architecture helps the flow of link juice to all your web pages, helping them rank well. Most often websites with architectural issues will behave similarly to a dam. All its link juice will be blocked at the website\u2019s homepage, which wouldn\u2019t allow the flow of link juice to its category, subcategory and content pages. Recently, I encountered this very problem with one of my clients. They were receiving thousands of links directed to their homepage but an entire section of their website was not indexed and nor did it pass any link juice to its category or content pages. They were not taking advantage of the vast amounts of link juice they were receiving due to poor website architecture (among other issues). Therefore, not only is it important to obtain high quality links (or link juice) to your site, but it is equally important to cash in on link juice to help bolster the ranking ability of all your web pages.\nI hope my (attempt at an) analogy helped you grasp the concept of link juice and how it ties in with website architecture. So how do you make sure your website architecture is SEO friendly?\nBelow you'll find a list of basic yet powerful list of tips that can help optimise the flow of link juice throughout your site.\nMost websites receive the highest number of back-links to their homepage. Therefore, in terms of link juice, homepages are generally rich. The medium by which link juice is distributed to the rest of the site is the global navigation menu. The global navigation helps link all category pages from the homepage. In order to find common issues with the global navigation, disable JavaScript on your web browser (this will allow you to see what search engines see) and check if the global navigation still works. If it doesn\u2019t, then this is cause for concern and should be addressed immediately. The most SEO friendly global navigation menus appear as standard HTML unordered lists. Also observe if all the major sections of your website are linked to from the global navigation. As mentioned earlier, all major sections of your website must be taking advantage of the homepage link juice.\nGenerally when a website has a sizeable number of web pages it is only logical to separate these pages by category. These pages serve two key purposes; first they need to be useful for users. For this, not only will you need to make sure it\u2019s simple for users to navigate through to content pages but you will also need to make sure that there is enough unique and useful content on these pages. Webmasters must put at least a minimal amount of effort into making these pages link worthy. Second, they need to act as \u2018link juice\u2019 routers. The links that they receive from the homepage need to be distributed to the content pages. In fact, if optimised cleverly and strategically, category pages have a strong chance of ranking on the SERPs for extremely competitive keywords.\nContent pages are the reason your visitors arrived at your site. In order to provide the greatest \u2018link juice\u2019 benefit to your content pages, make sure the number of clicks to your content page is as minimal as possible (don\u2019t hide your content 6-7 clicks away from the homepage). Also, in addition to making the content extremely relevant, you should make sure you make it easy for search engines to figure out the purpose of the page. In order to leave clues for search engines you can use the following:\n\u2022 Title tags\n\u2022 URL\n\u2022 The actual content and\n\u2022 Images\nMake sure your most relevant and targeted keywords are placed within the title tag of the page. Search engines generally display only 60-70 characters from the title tags on their search results page, so it is considered good practice to make sure you stick to this character limit. Personally, if the target keyword is extremely competitive I would place these keywords ahead of their brand name.\nURL structure is important because they\u2019re a great clue for search engine bots to make sense of the site\u2019s information hierarchy.\nwww.ExampleJewelleryStore.com/jewellery/engagement/rings/blue-sapphire-rings/\nThe above URL clearly defines the architectural hierarchy of the site. It lets the search engine know that this page is specific to blue sapphire engagement rings (not merely the stone).\nHowever, URLs that look like the following are not so clear about their architectural hierarchy or about defining the purpose of the page.\nwww.ExampleJewelleryStoreNumberTwo.com/products/sh01453868\nAlthough this is a no brainer, it is surprising as to how little thought is put into the actual content of many websites. Make sure content is unique and targets specific keywords. This does not mean stuffing your content with keywords, but make sure that the targeted keywords appear on your content naturally. It is also worth pointing out that attention should be given to spellings and grammar. See \u201c<a href=\"http://www.seoptimise.com/blog/2011/09/seos-%E2%80%93-time-to-brush-up-on-your-grammar.html\">Time to brush up on your grammar</a>\u201d for more on this subject.\nOf late, there\u2019s been much written about image optimisation and its correlation to attaining high rankings on SERPs, especially on image searches. Therefore it is best practice to include the alt text attribute in all HTML code for images for all publicly accessible pages. This attribute declares what text should be displayed if the user is unable to view the image. Therefore you should make sure you include keyword rich and descriptive alt text.\n", "comments": []}
