After the job change, Google bumped Schmidt's salary up from $1 a year to $1.25 million annually and awarded him a $100 million equity award comprised of stock and options, which vest over a four-year period.\nGoogle said at the time that the size of the original equity award was determined, based on \"market benchmarks for his new role as Executive Chairman and in recognition of his past service as CEO.\"\nThe current $100 million in equity vests over a four-year period, beginning in May 2015, Google said. The award was approved on January 29 by the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of Google's board.\nIn his role as executive chairman, Schmidt focuses on government outreach and deals. Google said the $6 million cash bonus is in recognition of Schmidt's contributions to Google's performance in 2013.\nGoogle's stock price rose 58.4 percent in 2013, breaking the $1,000 mark for the first time, while annual revenue increased 21 percent to $55.5 billion.\nGoogle CEO Page and Google co-founder Sergey Brin each received a base salary of $1 in 2012, the same salary they have received every year since 2004.\nThe two co-founders each have a large portion of their personal wealth tied directly to Google's stock.\n(Editing by Jan Paschal)\n", "comments": []}
