Its attempts to boost its market share have not yielded the desired results.\nIn September, it reported a net loss of $965m (\u00a3597m) for the second quarter, blaming poor sales of its new smartphone, the Z10.\nThe firm has also announced a plan to cut 4,500 jobs, or 40% of its workforce, to reverse the giant losses.\nMr Chen said the management changes were aimed at refining the company's strategy \"to ensure we deliver the best devices, mobile security and device management\".\n\"I look forward to working more directly with the talented teams of engineers, and the sales and marketing teams around the world to facilitate the BlackBerry turnaround and to drive innovation,\" he added.\n", "comments": []}
