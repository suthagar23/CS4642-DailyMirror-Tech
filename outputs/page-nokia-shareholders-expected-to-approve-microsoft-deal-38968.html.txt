The company's success helped to transform Finland from a backwater economy in the shadow of the Soviet Union into a high-tech powerhouse.\nAt Nokia's last regular shareholders' meeting, many shareholders took to the microphone to question CEO Stephen Elop's strategy, particularly his 2011 decision to adopt Microsoft's Windows Phone software over Nokia's own Symbian or Google's widely popular Android operating system.\nElop stepped down when he announced the agreement with Microsoft, his former employer, and is due to return to the Redmond, Washington company when the deal closes.\nFinnish tabloids have called him a \"Trojan horse\", although most analysts have been sympathetic, saying there were few good options for the company by the time he was hired in late 2010.\nOne Finnish businessman and former Nokia manager had set up a group called Nokita, translated as \"bet higher\" in Finnish, in an attempt to outbid Microsoft. He said on Monday that he failed to find enough investors.\n\"Of course there was a bit of a patriotic idea behind my plan, but there was also the calculation,\" said Juhani Parda, who believed Nokia's devices business could be worth around 23 billion euros in three years by adopting Android in addition to Windows Phone. \"I think 5.44 billion is definitely good for Microsoft. I'm not sure it's the best deal for shareholders.\"\n(Editing by Tom Pfeiffer)\n", "comments": []}
