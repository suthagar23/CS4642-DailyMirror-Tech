Earlier surveys have suggested the gap is even wider in the UK and parts of Europe.\nEarlier this month, Microsoft announced another tie-up with Facebook to integrate tips from the social network into Bing's results.\nUsers in the US are shown a new sidebar which identifies \"friends\" who can help answer queries based on topics they had \"liked\" or posted photos about.\nGoogle has also shown interest in being able to use Facebook to improve its search results but has criticised the fact that the site has refused to sign a data-sharing agreement.\nIn a recent interview on the US network PBS, Google's chief executive Larry Page described the situation as \"unfortunate\" adding that \"in general , I think we'd like to see content on the internet being made more open\".\n", "comments": []}
