The lawsuit does not contend that such large sums will be awarded.\nEspinoza also said last year's average $461,000 payout to non-employee directors was too high, being 43 percent larger than typical payouts at \"peer\" companies such as Amazon.com Inc and Walt Disney Co that on average generated twice as much revenue and three times more profit.\nFacebook spokeswoman Genevieve Grdina said in an email: \"The lawsuit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.\"\nA spokeswoman for Robbins Arroyo, a law firm representing the plaintiff, had no immediate comment.\nThe lawsuit alleges breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment.\nIt seeks to force directors to repay Facebook for alleged damages sustained by the Menlo Park, California-based company, and to impose \"meaningful limits\" subject to shareholder approval about how much stock the board can award itself.\nAmong the other defendants is Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, a director whose compensation was $16.15 million in 2013, according to a regulatory filing. She is worth $999 million, Forbes magazine said on Monday.\nZuckerberg made $653,165 last year, a regulatory filing shows, and Forbes said his net worth is $27.7 billion.\nEspinoza was also a plaintiff in a 2010 shareholder case in Delaware against Hewlett-Packard Co concerning its handling of the resignation of Chief Executive Mark Hurd over his relationship with a former contractor.\nThe case is Espinoza v. Zuckerberg et al, Delaware Chancery Court, No. 9745.\n(Additional reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware)\n", "comments": []}
