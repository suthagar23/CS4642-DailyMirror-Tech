Office Depot's website continued to offer the device for sale as of the afternoon.\nGoogle unveiled the 7-inch tablet, which the company hopes will allow it to better compete against Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc and funnel more people into its trove of online content, at its annual developer conference in San Francisco at the end of June.\nConsumers have been able to pre-order the tablet from Google and several retailers in past weeks, and Google said it began shipping devices to consumers on Friday.\n\"We blew through the first two allotments,\" a GameStop spokesperson said.\nA third allotment of preorders will be available in August. The game retailer declined to share exact number of preorders.\nThe Nexus 7 uses Google's Android mobile software, which has become the most prevalent operating system for smartphones globally, but has so far failed to make a big splash in the tablet market.\nBy taking a greater role in the tablet arena, Google hopes to ensure that its online services remain front-and-center to consumers, as tablets by Apple and Amazon are increasingly becoming gateways to the Web and Web-based content such as movies and music.\nGoogle executives have been quoted saying that the company will not generate a profit margin when the Nexus 7 is sold in retail stores. A report by research firm IHS iSuppli on Wednesday estimated that the bill of materials for the $199 version of the device, which features 8GB of flash memory and a high-end Tegra 3 processor by Nvidia Corp, is $152.\nApple still dominates the market for touch-screen tablet computers with its two-year old iPad. Amazon.com's $199 Kindle Fire tablet is based on open-source Android computer code, but the device features a customized interface that does not use many Google services.\nThe Nexus 7 has drawn accolades from reviewers like the Wall Street Journal's Walt Mossberg. Pundits reckon the $199 Nexus 7 may seriously threaten the same-priced Kindle Fire, especially since Google's offering has a camera and a higher-resolution screen.\nGoogle Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, speaking to reporters on Thursday at the Allen & Co conference in Sun Valley, said there was \"immense demand\" for the Nexus 7 in the first week after it was introduced.\nShares in the company climbed 1.1 percent to $576.52, buoyed by a broader U.S. market rally.\n(Additional reporting by Jessica Wohl and Dhanya Skariachan in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay)\n", "comments": []}
