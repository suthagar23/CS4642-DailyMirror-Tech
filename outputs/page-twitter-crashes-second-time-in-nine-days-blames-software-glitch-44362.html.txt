The stock rose as much as 3.7 percent before Twitter confirmed the glitch, but gave up most of the gains to end 0.25 percent higher.\nThe outage occurred just as Twitter co-founder Biz Stone took the stage in Austin, Texas, to speak at the South by Southwest Interactive festival, the annual gathering of tech enthusiasts that helped propel Twitter to national fame in 2007.\nTwitter crashed briefly on March 2 during the Academy Awards, when the company's infrastructure was overwhelmed by a flood of tweets and retweets about a \"selfie\" featuring Oscar show host Ellen DeGeneres, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and many other celebrities.\nTwitter, which was plagued by frequent outages during its early years, invested heavily in improving its site reliability before it went public in November 2013.\n(Reporting by Jim Finkle and Gerry Shih)\n", "comments": []}
