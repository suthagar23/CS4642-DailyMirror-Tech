There is also the expectation of an \"iPad Mini\" and new Nexus-branded devices.\nOne analyst said that with so many competing products on offer, display quality was become a deciding factor for some consumers.\n\"Screen resolution has become a differential point for many manufacturers,\" Chris Green, principal technology analyst at Davies Murphy Group Europe, told the BBC.\n\"Given that many people now use their devices to stream video, having a high-resolution that can best show off HD video is far more important than it was two years ago.\n\"There is still a trade-off though as some of these displays consume more power as a result, and battery technologies have not kept pace with other advances. Since screens are the biggest power drain on mobile devices, that's why a lot of research is going into how to reduce their energy needs.\"\n", "comments": []}
