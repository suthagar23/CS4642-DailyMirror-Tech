The Federal Circuit decision means that the ITC will take up the case again.\nIn July 2011, InterDigital said it was looking into a possible sale of the company but it said in January that it had failed to find takers.\nIn June this year, InterDigital said it had agreed to sell about 1,700 wireless technology patents for $375 million to Intel Corp.\nInterDigital, which primarily licenses technology, had second quarter revenues of $71.9 million, and $301.7 million for fiscal 2011.\nThe case at the Federal Circuit is No. 2010-1093. The case at the ITC is No. 337-613.\n(Reporting By Diane Bartz; Editing by Tim Dobbyn, Bernard Orr)\n", "comments": []}
