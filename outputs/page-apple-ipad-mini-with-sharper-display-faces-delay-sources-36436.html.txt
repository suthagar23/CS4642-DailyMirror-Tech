One source at a supplier said there were delays in Apple's certification of panel producers, which were given strict power-saving requirements.\nLG Display Co Ltd, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's display unit and Sharp Corp all vied to manufacture the panels, supply chain sources said.\nThe three display makers declined to comment.\nGiven the time required to ramp up screen production, a retina display-equipped iPad Mini would not be available in large volumes until early next year, the sources said.\nThe sources expected Apple to either wait until early next year for a full-fledged launch of a retina display iPad Mini, or to make a retina version only available in limited quantities before the end of the year.\nApple has also told suppliers to reduce costs, two of the sources said, with one person saying the U.S. firm is looking at rolling out an iPad Mini with a smaller 8 gigabytes of memory.\nLess memory may allow Apple to lower the price of the Mini to boost sales in emerging markets like China where cheaper tablets, many of them running Google's Android operating system, are gaining market share.\n\"Right now the iPad Mini is more expensive than everyone else in the 7- to 8-inch tablet segment,\" said Arthur Liao, an analyst for Fubon Securities in Taipei. \"If it could reduce its price by even just $50, it would appeal to more consumers.\"\nThe iPad's total market share almost halved to 32.5 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, while Android devices, including Samsung's Galaxy series, gained nearly a quarter to 62.6 percent, a survey by tech research company IDC showed.\nAmazon's new 7-inch Kindle Fire is priced from $229 for 16GB wifi-only models, while Google's second-generation Nexus 7 offers a similar screen size and storage capacity at the same price. By comparison, the cheapest model in Apple's current 7.9-inch iPad Mini lineup with 16GB storage size starts at $329.\nAnyone expecting Apple to dramatically cut prices is likely to be disappointed, analysts said, pointing to the higher-than-expected price tag for the iPhone 5C unveiled this month.\n\"Don't expect the prices to be significantly lower,\" said one of the sources. \"Even though Apple aims to cut down on component costs, it still ends up around the same as the current Mini because the new Mini will have upgraded specifications.\"\n(Additional reporting by Poornima Gupta in San Francisco, Miyoung Kim in Seoul and Mari Saito in Tokyo; Editing by Edmund Klamann and Miral Fahmy)\n", "comments": []}
