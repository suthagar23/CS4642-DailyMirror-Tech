Google says it will support Samsung in that effort.\nMeanwhile, sales of the Galaxy Nexus from the Google Play store appear to have been halted, with the phone's availability status changed to \"Coming Soon.\"\nSo for now it appears to be a race to see which will be in place first -- the patch or the cash, with the future of American Galaxy Nexus sales hanging in the balance, and on the 4th of July, no less. The humanity!\nOne thing we've all learned from this latest development -- if you ever felt scorned while waiting what seems like an interminable amount of days for an update to your phone, the feeling is apparently justified now that we've witnessed the breathtaking speed at which Google is working to push out this patch to satiate the legal system.\n", "comments": []}
