It requires actual movement and encourages you to get outside to unlock new features, weapons and adventures. For example, to control and capture things called \u201cportals\u201d \u2014 which spew matter from creative places such as museums and libraries \u2014 you have to go there. Once you connect three portals, you form a region and claim a territory.\nThis means if you are in Times Square, the app\u2019s built-in scatter map technology knows where you are and adds a virtual layer to it. It leads you to real statues and landmarks to continue the game. The platform also works in rural communities too.\nThe news comes as the Niantic Lab teased videos leading up to the launch, which included taglines such as \u201cthere\u2019s more for the world to see.\u201d\nHeading the Niantic Lab team is John Hanke, the location-based guru behind Google Earth, Google Maps and StreetView. Hanke was previously the CEO of mapping tech company Keyhole which was acquired by Google in 2004.\n\u201cWe live in a world of abundant information and ubiquitous computing \u2014 why not play in it? For the first time, the world, not the screen, can become the basis for a mobile game \u2014 it\u2019s a controller in the palm of your hand,\u201d Hanke told Mashable.\n", "comments": []}
